lintian (1.22.11) unstable; urgency=low

  Jeroen van Wolffelaar <jeroen@wolffelaar.nl>
   * Upgrade lintian itself to policy 3.6.1
     + Drop question about removing lab on purge, just do it.
   * Update to Debian Policy 3.6.1, all references broken by
     section-reorganization are updated (Closes: #194257, #208945, #214949,
     also closes: #217384, #231884)
     (Patch by Nicholas Breen <nbreen@ofb.net>)
   * Support for dash scripts (Closes: #194787)
     (Patch by Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>)
   * checks/binaries.desc:
     + Fix typo (Closes: #202856)
   * checks/deb-format, debian/control:
     + Rewrite by Denis Barbier, slightly cleaned up, renders
       libarchive-tar-perl dependency unneeded (Closes: #232875)
   * checks/filenames (and more):
     + Check for Subversion version control leftovers (Closes: #190067)
     + Ignore empty __init__.py files in /usr/share/doc (Closes: #215234)
       (based on patch by Frank Lichtenheld <djpig@debian.org>)
   * checks/cruft:
     + Check for CVS and Subversion cruft in source packages (Closes: #189776,
       also closes: #190067)
   * checks/po-debconf
     + Rewrite in Perl
     + Obsolete PO files are no more checked because po2debconf now
       automatically runs debconf-updatepo if PO files are older than
       templates files.  Of course PO files might be outdated (e.g. when
       downloaded from a BR), but it should occur seldom.
     + PO files are processed through msgfmt to ensure they are valid.
     + Based on patch by Denis Barbier <barbier@debian.org>, Closes: #210576
     + Check whether po-debconf is used at all, and warn if it isn't
     + Check for required POTFILES.in and template.pot in debian/po
   * checks/menu-format
     + Drop menu-icon-has-bad-colors, it doesn't apply anymore (Closes: #199341)

     + Added three checks for correct su-to-root usage (Closes: #188095)
     + Understand icon32x32 and icon16x16 (Closes: #200046)
     + Missing required tags are now an error (and check name changed)
     + Check tag-quotation
     + Rewrite needs check properly, being more precise what is allowed
     + Complain about needs="dwww", as this is obsolete accordint to menu
       maintainer
       (parts menu-format updates based on patch by Bill Allombert
       <ballombe@debian.org>)
   * checks/scripts
     + Recognise the 'tcl' interpreter, not the same as tclsh (Closes: #230182)

       manpage-not-compressed (Closes: #225293)
   * checks/copyright-file: don't complain about missing reference to
      the GPL if we already detected a wrong reference (Closes: #225837)
   * checks/debconf:
     + don't complain about partially-translated-question, if
       Choices is only a substitution variable (Closes: #200802,#222648)
     + fix testing of dependencies to eliminate false
       positives of missing-debconf-dependency (Closes: #195201)

  * Lintian maintainance is now in the hands of the `Debian Lintian
    Maintainers' group
  * Add check for tar bug #230910
    (tar check written by Marc 'HE' Brockschmidt <marc@marcbrockschmidt.de>)

 -- Jeroen van Wolffelaar <jeroen@wolffelaar.nl>  Fri, 13 Feb 2004 01:00:48 +0100

lintian (1.22.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * config.* files from 2000-09-05 and such had the timestamp in a
    variable called version, not timestamp, so check for that as well
    to detect the really old ones as well.
  * Made sharedobject-in-library-directory-not-actually-a-shlib an E
    because it uses the same method as
    pkg-has-shlibs-control-file-but-no-actual-shared-libs does, and that
    one's pretty reliable and already E, closes: #197951
  * Fixed logic error in detecting whether the uncompressed changelog
    file is really a symlink, closes: #198171.
  * Ripped out those few remaining bits of code that watched over /usr/doc,
    closes: #193598.
  * Don't whine about policy 3.5.10. No changes.
  * Avoid install-docs' --no-update-menus when checking for update-menus
    calls, closes: #183193.
  * Close the IN filehandle in menus:check_script() so that $. gets
    properly reset (sloppy coding -- argh!).
  * Fixed a $1 overwriting thinko in debhelper checks.
  * Demoted build-depends-without-arch-dep from E to W. "Most likely"
    isn't non-heuristic, dammit.

lintian (1.22.8.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed a small logic oversight in the new debhelper compat check,
    closes: #187415.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Apr 2003 12:27:55 +0200

lintian (1.22.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the list of virtual packages, closes: #179614, #180421.
  * Fixed typo in the LaTeX license exception, closes: #184640.
  * Removed anal-retentive check for a bug in debconf << 1.2.9,
    closes: #185721.
  * Updated policy version in the description, closes: #185882.
  * Checks in debian/compat for debhelper compat version, and warns
    if it finds that as well as DH_COMPAT, closes: #186269.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Wed,  2 Apr 2003 19:22:37 +0200

lintian (1.22.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adjusted Policy references for changes in the shared library stuff.
    Updated standards-version checks to recognize 3.5.9, and shifted
    old/ancient borders to 3.5.7/3.5.2.
  * Allow for ${1+"$@"} as well in the evil exec line check, closes: #179145.
  * Removed the CXXABI check because it's not reliable enough, not all
    C++-linked programs include libsupc++ which provides those symbols.
    Sorry. Closes: #179278, #184729.
  * Allow /usr/lib/$pkg in the rpath check, thanks to Matej Vela,
    closes: #173610.
  * Added /usr/share/pixmaps to the icon file path, closes: #181552.
  * Ignored symlinks in the gzip -9 check for changelogs, closes: #181899.
  * Ignore LaTeX license in the common-licenses check for GPL, thanks
    to Peter van Rossum, closes: #184640.
  * Included (tcl|tk)8.4 on their respective lists, thanks to Chris Waters,
    closes: #184655.
  * Ignore alternatives in the check for duplicate relations, closes: #184660.
    It's still not inclusive, but the remaining cases should be rare enough.
  * Added Denis Barbier's po-debconf checks, closes: #173823.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Mar 2003 23:21:41 +0100

lintian (1.22.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added missing description for empty-manual-page.
  * Adjusted some descriptions for -dev symlinks.
  * Updated the policy section for copyright files from 13.6 to 13.5,
    closes: #177769.
  * Updated the policy section for changelog files from 13.8 to 13.7,
    closes: #176946.
  * Added extended-description-line-too-long, closes: #176784.
  * Warn against lack of CXXABI, thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #175920.
  * Allow for all the other tricks scripts play with their interpreters
    by making the check generic, /^\s*exec\s*.+\s*.?\$0.?\s*.?\$\@/.
    Thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #175602.
  * Changed the dh_testversion checks to also find disparities between
    DH_COMPAT and debhelper build-dep version, closes: #175295.
  * Ignore packages that build-depend on autotools-dev in the config.*
    date check, since they probably copy stuff around, closes: #178347.

 -- Josip Rodin <joy-packages@debian.org>  Thu, 30 Jan 2003 17:03:15 +0100

lintian (1.22.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore Zope's license in
    copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl, thanks to
    Matej Vela, closes: #172211.
  * Don't require \S+ but .+ while parsing @packages, closes: #172444.
  * Rewrote the chunk of code dealing with names of manual pages, because
    it was done all wrong, closes: #173548.
  * Ignore files consisting merely of .so links completely, thanks to
    Matej Vela, closes: #173609.
  * Added code to check for bad-so-link-within-manual-page.
  * Also added code to check for empty-manual-page.
  * Added a few more cases of safe ldconfig invocation in postrm,
    closes: #174042. Didn't handle the one with the "case" statement,
    it's too bothersome. Oh well, the check is a warning instead of
    an error for a reason.
  * Added a check for the timestamp line in config.guess/sub files,
    closes: #171295.
  * Renamed the full-stop check to
    description-synopsis-might-not-be-phrased-properly and rephrased its
    description. This is where I draw the line :) closes: #174150.
  * Added a warning on .pl and .pm files within /usr/lib/perl5,
    closes: #174595.
  * Renamed pkg-without-shlibs-has-shlibs-control-file to
    pkg-has-shlibs-control-file-but-no-actual-shared-libs and improved
    its long description.
  * Added sharedobject-in-library-directory-not-actually-a-shlib,
    which should properly address the issue of SONAME-less libraries,
    closes: #174928.
  * Exclude files that match "LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 1.6.1" from the
    copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl check,
    closes: #174929.

lintian (1.22.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in the description of description-synopsis-ends-with-full-stop,
    closes: #172049.
  * Slightly clarified the text as well, and added a pointer to Policy 5.7.1.
  * Made it a warning, not an error which it was by mistake, closes: #172541.
  * Removed an extra colon from copyright-file-lacks-pointer-to-perl-license.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Wed, 11 Dec 2002 20:39:38 +0100

lintian (1.22.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed typo in copyright-should-refer-to-common-license-file-for-gpl
    which caused it to have no description. Also moved the opening of
    the pipe to lintian-info before the first print E: line so that
    bad-distribution-in-changes-file and other tags in lintian.desc
    actually get displayed, closes: #171737.
  * Updated the description of link-to-undocumented-manpage to better
    match the current Policy and be more helpful.
  * Added missing \Q and \E around the variable in
    description-synopsis-is-duplicated, closes: #171721.
  * Don't warn on _any_ mention of update-rc.d in postinst, just those that
    follow whitespace or something else and a semicolon, closes: #171472.

 -- Josip Rodin <jrodin@jagor.srce.hr>  Thu,  5 Dec 2002 12:25:17 +0100

lintian (1.22.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed some random glitches.
  * Change rgb-vs-cmap to first include the hex codes of colors in cmap.xpm,
    and then go searching for names in rgb.txt. Updated the cmap.xpm
    location in the description. This hopefully really closes: #170860.
  * Added exception in the shell syntax checks for evil rep scripts,
    thanks to Kevin Ryde, closes: #171175.
  * Added checks for multiple dependencies on libstdc, tcl, tclx, tk, tkx
    and libpng packages. This is currently beind done in a hardcoded manner,
    but that should do for now, closes: #80447, #129548.
  * Added a regression test as part of the relations regression test for
    the above multiple dependencies.
  * Don't barf on /var/local in the FSSTND-dir-in-var check, just in
    non-standard-dir-in-var, closes: #119414. The normal packages
    shouldn't install anything there anyway, and base-files can have
    overrides :)
  * Prepend a slash to the file names in file-in-etc-not-marked-as-conffile,
    closes: #122285. We already don't have the prepended thing normalized,
    so why not indulge this.
  * Added dh_suidregister-is-obsolete, closes: #94031.
  * Added copyright-lists-upstream-authors-with-dh_make-boilerplate,
    closes: #107815. I am now the official maintainer so I get to do that >:)
    This time I've written the description much better, so there should
    be no confusion like there was the last time.
  * Added description-synopsis-is-duplicated first by comparing the
    lowercased synopsis with the lowercased start of the extended
    description, and then if that fails, the letters and numbers are
    removed and the strings are compared. This may not catch _everything_,
    but should be satisfactory, and it closes: #118098.
  * Added a regression test for the above error to the other relations test.
    It seemed handy. :)
  * Added an error for depending on libdb1-compat, just in case, as advised
    by Colin Watson.

lintian (1.22.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Handle the $statistics_file rotation in harness.
  * Warn on dh_dhelp use, thanks to Chris Tillman, closes: #130016.
  * Exempt awk from the virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
    check, and add an error when there's a non-versioned dependency on awk,
    closes: #136831. The description may be considered vague for some
    cases, but I'll wait until someone actually complains about that
    before rewriting it.
  * Moved the generic exceptions before the script-without-interpreter check,
    which should fix Daniel Kobras' dx false positive, closes: #165574.
  * Added a warning for full stop in the synopsis line, thanks to
    Colin Walters, closes: #131747.
  * Added a warning for daemon stopping stuff in postinst, without
    a dependency on debconf (>= 1.2.9), thanks to Martin Godisch,
    closes: #168621.
  * Based on hints from in Jim Van Zandt's otherwise rather flawed patch
    posted in bug #94928, moved the diff file stuff from the cruft check
    into the diffstat collector, and made it simply extract the patch into
    a file called "debian-patch" which is then used elsewhere, instead of
    zcatting it over and over again.
  * Added a regression test for the debian/files and config.* checks.
  * Added config.log to the list of configure-generated files to warn about.
  * Updated menu icon colors with a little script I wrote, closes: #170860.
  * It appears File::Find has changed semantics since woody and now refuses
    to follow a symlink as the name of the directory to scan. Obviously,
    a simple readlink() fixes it.
  * I realized that bug #122855 couldn't have been fixed the diff scanning
    code anyhow, since dpkg-source ignores file deletions in the first place.
    Removed the hours of work and simply expanded on the description of the
    error instead. Oh well.
  * Added an error for GPL copyrights that don't refer to
    /usr/share/common-licenses, thanks to Edward Betts, closes: #99885.
  * Added a warning for some popular architecture-independent image files
    in /usr/lib which suggests moving them to /usr/share per FHS, thanks to
    Bill Allombert, closes: #114474.

  * Further updated the python script checks to ignore obsolete -base
    packages and watch versioned python interpreters better, thanks
    to Federico Di Gregorio and Luca De Vitis, closes: #169872.
  * Added an exception for sash in the statically-linked-binary check,
    as reported by H. S. Teoh.
  * Moved descriptions for two manual page location consistency checks
    from shared-libs.desc (?!) to manpages.desc, and clarified them,
    as reported by Othmar Pasteka.
  * Accept /var/games as an exception for setgid stuff, closes: #169382.
  * Removed the /etc/ppp perms exception as per discussion on debian-devel.
  * Fixed the add-log-mailing-address check by not re-my-ing the prefix
    and suffix variables in each iteration of the loop, closes: #129581.
    Added the word obsolete in the name of the error and a paragraph break
    to further clarify it.
  * Added Apps/Science as a valid menu section. This and the removal of
    the error for calling ldconfig anywhere in the postinst in 1.21.5
    make Lintian Policy 3.5.8 compliant, closes: #170093.
  * Exclude .png files from the extra-license-file check, closes: #164017.
  * Exclude .php files from the extra-license-file check, closes: #116384.
  * Added documentation-package-not-architecture-independent warning in
    the cruft check, closes: #120261.
  * Check if $action is defined before comparing it to avoid a warning with
    the -C option, closes: #129582.
  * Added Kevin Ryde's patch that implements menu-icon-too-big,
    menu-icon-has-bad-colors, menu-icon-cannot-be-parsed, closes: #71396.
  * Make .nfs* files trigger the backup-file-in-package check, closes: #95140.
  * Added an error for .xvpics directories, closes: #169831.
  * Added more misspellings from Matt Zimmerman, without the British
    English stuff, with the four language names in a special arrangement,
    closes: #119786.
  * Made package-contains-CVS-dir an error, closes: #147301.
  * Added an error for /usr/share/doc/<something>/examples/examples
    directory, closes: #153144.
  * Added an error for referring to the Perl license terms without actually
    pointing to their location on the file system, thanks to Gergely Nagy,
    closes: #157449.
  * Check for localhost(.localdomain) in the Maintainer fields,
    closes: #162248.
  * Fixed the needs=dwww exception in the menu file check for an empty
    section, thanks to Colin Watson, closes: #170437.
  * Check for debian-qa@l.d.o in Maintainer fields, thanks to Colin Watson,
    closes: #126687.
  * Updated standards-version check to declare anything lesser than 3.2
    ancient (1999!), and anything lesser than 3.5.6 old (2001).

  * Fix two regexps in the scripts check in order to fix *sh -n checking,
    closes: #167079.
  * Added duplicate-conffile error, closes: #131632.
  * There doesn't appear to be any provision in the Policy or in the FHS
    for random compatibility symlinks, so I've just added "or symbolic
    link" to the description of file-in-unusual-dir, closes: #135546.
  * Fixed the regexp for package-contains-CVS-dir to actually recognize
    directories that are printed with the trailing slash, closes: #146831.
  * Made unregistered-script-in-etc-init.d a warning, renamed it to
    script-in-etc-init.d-not-registered-via-update-rc.d and updated
    its description to mention why it may not be an error, closes: #118823.
  * Added dash into the regexps in the scripts check.
  * Added a crude check for code within another shell (foosh -c something).
    I say crude because it works with oneliners only -- anything that spans
    lines sounds like pretty much impossible to do in without actually
    _being_ a shell script interpreter :) closes: #166483.
  * Added an exception for /etc/ppp being 750 root:dip, and complain if
    it exists and it's not like that, closes: #169260.
  * Expunged the notion of a global override file from the tag descriptions.

  * Removed postinst-unsafe-ldconfig warning as per the discussion in
    #120585, which also conveniently closes: #117260, #114123.
    Note that postrm-unsafe-ldconfig stays!
  * Further improvements to reporting/harness, reporting/html_reports
    and related code.
  * Fixed the display of info for python-script-but-no-python-dep on
    python1*.

lintian (1.21.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Just check for bashisms in sh files, thanks to Jay Bonci for
    pointing me a this.
  * Recognize python source packages called pythonX.Y, which should fix
    third-party-package-in-python-dir for all of them, closes: #114281.
    Also extend the checking of that directory on all X.Y and not just 1.5.
  * Fixed policy references in several init script related tags, made the
    init.d not conffile check a warning since Policy allows otherwise and we
    can't check reliably, extended the rc.d file check on rc(\d|S).d and
    excluded sysvinit and file-rc from the check. All this closes: #118824.

  * Do _not_ close STDERR before running dpkg-source in unpack-srcpkg-l2.
    The logname stuff has been fixed ages ago so there shouldn't be any
    remotely valid reason to do this. This should explain bugs like #159474
    and #162813 to the submitters, but I'll have to wait and see, since
    I still can't reproduce it myself.
  * Fixed the cruft check not to check the diff file just once, not for
    every damn subdirectory of the source, d'oh.
  * Backed out the --remove-lab move to postrm, lintian doesn't exist there
    any more, silly, closes: #166309.

  * Changed the default path for ksh to /bin/ksh, as per the change
    in the pdksh package, closes: #131484.
    Maybe /usr/bin/ksh should still be allowed, but it seems inconsistent
    to allow several paths like that... perhaps the same should be done
    for zsh? Although, I suppose there are less zsh scripts out there
    compared to ksh.
  * Added $link to the usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package error message,
    hopefully properly closes: #116309 (untested).
  * Eradicated the remaining Packaging Manual references, from
    Chris Tillman's patch in #116488. Also removed FSSTND references.
  * Fixed typo in description-is-dh_make-template, closes: #145802.
  * Replaced /usr/share/doc with /usr/doc in checks/copyright-file.desc,
    thanks Matej, closes: #157423.
  * Set binary mode to be able to grok UTF-8 with Perl 5.8 when reading
    override files, thanks to Colin in #158119. Maybe this is all wrong,
    but it shouldn't hurt anyway. :)
  * Added Colin's patch check manual pages for correctness with lexprog,
    along with the appropriate versioned dependency on man-db, closes: #52524.
  * Cleaned up some typos in copyrights.
  * Added *sh -n checking for syntax errors in shell scripts, closes: #42348.
  * Moved script checks from control-files to the second part of scripts,
    and also noticed and fixed a bug -- if a script e.g. called killall and
    had a bashism on the same line, it would escape undetected.
  * Check the .diff.gz file (if it exists) for config.(cache|status) that
    includes no added and a number of removed lines and don't print the
    configure-generated-file-in-source error for those files, closes: #122855.
    The diff output analysis isn't perfect, but it oughta work.
  * Clarified the virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends
    warning with an additional paragraph, closes: #164813.
  * Updated the testset/check_info.pl to work, similarly to lintian-info.
  * Updated the testsets (this verified my s/elsif/if/g bug fix in
    checks/scripts mentioned above).
  * Updated %known_essential as per my sid available file.
  * Updated %known_virtual_packages as per Policy's virtual packages list.

lintian (1.21.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed FHS transition stuff from lintian's own maintainer scripts.
    Lintian is now Lintian-clean. :o)
  * Moved the purge stuff from the old prerm to postrm, and made the
    (possibly redundant; to-do) question more forgiving.
  * Added a doc-base file and run install-docs, closes: #129509.
  * Removed spurious no-manpage exception for binaries that end in
    numbers, closes: #118479.
  * Fixed lintian-info's broken $ENV{LINTIAN_ROOT} use. 
  * Fixed --setup-lab to ignore already-existing packages, thanks to
    Chris Tillman, closes #83593. Let's hope it all works out :o)
  * Updated the list of allowed distributions, closes: #150466.
  * Removed the leading ./ from filenames in %linked_against_libvga which
    actually makes it work, thanks to Matej Vela, closes: #157317.
  * Warn against all uncompressed changelogs, thanks again to Matej Vela,
    closes: #157318.
  * Nuked the code that checked that that for every /usr/share/doc/foo -> ...
    symlink there exists an equivalent /usr/doc/foo -> ... symlink;
    seems to be a leftover from the FHS transition days, thanks yet again
    to Matej Vela for the patch, closes: #161716.

lintian (1.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer.
  * Applied the ever so appropriately named ``unfuck'' patch to the lab
    code. It includes but is not limited to:
     + code to read the pool from Bas Zoetekouw
     + other changes to support new style distributions from myself
     + fixes for the breakage induced by Shaleh's blitheful insertion of
       "use strict" everywhere
     + an array of assorted fixes from Colin Watson, myself and perhaps
       others which I've accidentally forgotten.
    The lab code is now officially not entirely broken. Yay! :)
    There's still work to be done, but this still closes: #157369, #157942.

  * Accept Joy's NMU patch (he applied it as 1.20.14.1).
    Closes: #110991, #109244.
  * Warn if the copyright file contains dh-perl-make boilerplate as suggested
    by James Troup.  In the process debmake-templates-in-copyright became
    helper-templates-in-copyright.  Closes: #110337.
  * Oops, used the same argument name (-s) twice.  Reverted back to -s meaning
    "source".  Updated manpage and source to reflect this.  Closes: #109631.
  * added a warning when hardlinks are used.  Closes: #103893, #97518.
    I am closing #97518 here as well which asked that I warn about hard links
    that link to files in another directory.  Since I warn about hardlinks
    existing adding a separate check for where they link seems silly.
  * applied Edward Betts patch to detect .cvsignore and CVS/.  Closes: #74684.
  * applied Daniel Schleper's patch for Build-Depends v. Build-Depends-Indep.

  * Made doc-base-references-usr-doc inform which file is the culprit.
    Closes: #111020.
  * Applied Steve M. Robbins' patch for improved handling of ldconfig checks

    are not checked.
  * oops I left 'debian' in the spelling check list.
  * backed out Gergely Nagy's suggestion for checking for 'Author(s)'.  That
    is just overly pedantic and lame.  Reopens: #107815, tagged wontfix.
  * checks/etcfiles now complains about ANY file found in /etc that is not a
    conffile.  The finer grain checks have been removed.  Closes: #103940.
    Added a new testset 'etcfiles' to go along with the test.

  * Added an error for leaving files generated by autoconf in the source
    package, patch from Colin Watson, closes: #107679, #94316.
    This pulled in renaming checks/debian-cruft* to cruft*, logically.
  * Added checks/infofiles* for everything related to info files, moved

  * Added "Debian/GNU Linux" among the corrections in checks/spelling,
    closes: #35761. It required some other modifications but oh well.
  * Added a new warning, doc-base-file-references-usr-doc, closes: #46582.

    checks/menus*.
  * Added a new error, debian-changelog-file-contains-user-emacs-settings,

    Also, fixed some thinkos in the code for the latter warning.
  * No longer barfs on debhelper-generated safe ldconfig calls, patch from
    Paul Martin, closes: #82479.
  * Added the recent Policy versions up to 3.5.6 to standards-version,

    version was released a bit more than one year ago, closes: #104766.
  * Added a new error, package-depends-on-an-x-font-package. The pattern
    is ^xfont.*, that ought to work fine (xfntil2 et al will go undetected,

    encounters a newer standards version than it knows about. Closes: #84083
  * updated references to policy for policy 3.5.0. Closes: #84088, #83969
  * Added a warning for packages containing a link to undocumented(7) as
    suggested on debian-policy list.  Also includes a testset (manpages) 
    addition.
    Closes: #83188
  * At the moment checks/copyright-file just tests for a slash in the link;
    I've changed it here to test for an initial / or ../, and then after that
    check it strips off everything from the first slash on, so that tests on
    the package name work correctly when people link to subdirectories of
    other /usr/share/doc directories.  Closes: #84066
  * It was unpacking to level 2 even though I had Unpack-Level: 1 and no
    associated collection scripts. Of course, it wanted override files from
    /usr/share/lintian/overrides/$pkg. Fair enough - except that if I said 
    --no-override it wanted the override file information anyway, and still
    unpacked to level 2.  No obeys non-overrides.  Closes: #84722

lintian (1.20.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * the change hurts release
  * every perl script now calls use strict and passes -w to perl
    The long road of bug tracking because of this has begun.  Thanks Joey H.
  * testset/filenames now has a lengthy-symlink bug to show how that code works
  * typo in checks/control-files in a bashism check, the correct POSIX call
    is 'read foo' however the code was checking for the existance of whitespace
    before the call, not the existance of the variable to read into due to a
    mixed up regex.  Thanks Adam Heath for pointing this out. Closes: #81453
  * checks/control-files, the check for whether '.' takes more than one
    argument did not take into account things like 'and'.  It does now.
    Closes: #81737
  * fixed interpreter check code to hand a space between the #! and the
    interpreter (really), also allows bash,ksh,ash as valid sh shells. Also
    knows to look for an ELF header and stop parsing the script. Thanks
    Colin Watson.  Closes: #80348, #82541
  * testet/binary-1 added.  This is a small C program to test lintian's 
    handling of binary files.  See the changelog in this directory for info
  * fixed message for 'manpage-has-wrong-extension', Closes: #82452
  * 'N: Unknown interpreter' message now only printed once per script,
    Closes: #81644
  * added equivalent file-directly-in-usr-share-doc messages (et al.),
    Closes: #82654
  * added new message: suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script. this replaces
    the old messages suidregister-used-in-maintainer-script-other-than-postinst
    and suidunregister-not-called-in-postrm due to suidregister being phased
    out of Debian.  Closes: #81868

    checks/control-files.desc explains the problem in detail
  * fixed checks/menus setting of is_sh, $foo = split() sets foo to the number
    of items, not the first item -- duh (-:  How did this make it thru testing?

  * removed references to libtool-workarounds.txt (it never died ....),
    Closes: #78420
  * my reformat of the code in checks/menu-format changed the regex from
    m/^#/ to m/^	#/, I changed it back (kind of).  The test is now
    m/^\s*\#/ just in case a space snuck in.  Also modified the code so it
    does a if (m//) { next;} rather than if (! m//) { ........ }.
    Closes: #78532
  * checks/menus now checks which interpreter the maint script uses and varies
    its checks accordingly -- works for sh and perl currently, Closes: #78880
    Updated menus.desc while I was at it.
  * fixed typo in scripts.desc, pike error message should have referred to pike
    not to make, Closes: #79744

  * No longer emit executable-in-usr-doc for scripts.  It's just too

    for people who are interested.  This closes bug#28560, by

  * Changed a lot of "error:" messages to "internal error:", to make
    clear that they are errors in Lintian's execution, not in the package
    being checked.  This closes bug#31013, submitted by James Troup.

    tag for regular files.  Reported by Martin Schulze.

  * Corrected libtool-workaround sample configure.in snippet:
    Look for *-*-linux-gnu, not *-pc-linux-gnu.
    Fixes bug#30756, reported by James Troup.

  * Made lintian abort with an error message when objdump can't handle
    a binary's file format.  Also made lintian Suggest binutils-multiarch.

  * New error tag: arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share
    This closes bug#30742, reported by Matthias Klose.

  * Added gnuplot as a known interpreter.  Suggestion by Rafael Laboissiere.

lintian (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * New features (summary):
    - 112 new spelling corrections.
    - Minor efficiency improvements.
    - Checks __register_frame_info problems.
    - Updated to policy 2.5.0

  * (lib/util.pl) Exit with code 2 when failing, like the manpage says.
  * (checks/files) Print octal permissions in
    bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script, not decimal.
  * (checks/files)
    Ignore .xpm extensions too when hunting for extra license files.
  * (checks/conffiles, checks/conffiles.desc)
    Renamed -may-not-be- tags to -must-not-be-, for clarity.

  * Replaced most bash scripts with perl scripts, for faster startup times
    and fewer subprocesses.  This speeds up lintian by some 30% on my machine.
  * (collection/objdump-info)
    Add -T flag, to collect dynamic symbols table too.
  * (checks/binaries)
    Look for __register_frame_info and __unregister_frame_info.
    New tag: compiled-with-bad-libc

  * (checks/*.desc) Use new (2.5.0) section numbering for policy references.
  * (checks/changelog-file) Accept changelog.html.gz files.
  * (checks/standards-version) newer-standards-version is warning, not error.
    This fixes bug#29366, reported by Julian Gilbey <jdg@maths.qmw.ac.uk>.
  * (checks/standards-version) Updated to standards-version 2.5.0.

  * (info/overrides) New overrides.
    Fixes bug#29449 reported by Marcus Brinkmann (libc5 overrides)

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Remove the link to the upgrading-checklist,
    which I can no longer find and which is probably not maintained anymore.

  * (checks/control-files) Fix check for mknod-in-maintainer script:
    pipes are made with p, not -p.

  * (debian/control) In the package description, mention which policy
    version Lintian checks.

lintian (0.9.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/binaries) Warn if a package with ELF binaries does not have
    a Depends line.  New tag: missing-depends-line.
    (Suggested by Charles Briscoe-Smith)

  * (checks/menus) Don't warn about /usr/lib/menu/README.
    (Noted by joost witteveen)

  * (checks/binaries.desc, checks/binaries, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Renamed "shlib-without-dependency-information" to
    "shared-lib-without-dependency-information", to avoid confusion with
    the shlibs control file.  (Suggested by Branden Robinson)
    Also moved the tag info from shared-libs.desc to binaries.desc, where
    it belongs.

  * (checks/shared-libs)
    Suppress "shlib-with-executable-bit" error if a library has an
    INTERP header.  This catches the libraries (such as libc or libm)
    that print a little banner when executed.

  * (checks/fields)
    Report maintainer addresses that have no dots in the domain part.
    (Suggestion by James Troup)
  * Teach fields check about non-us.

  * (info/perl-modules)  Updated modules info.
  * (lib/deplib.pl)  Fixed handling of versioned dependencies.

  * (checks/files.desc)  In executable-in-usr-doc tag, suggest examples
    directory as a place for executables.
    (Suggestion by Stephane Bortzmeyer)

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: depends-on-obsolete-package, to flag dependencies on 
    old libraries.

  * Look for more misspellings:
      dependant -> dependent, dependancy -> dependency,
      definate -> definite, definately -> definitely.
  * (checks/scripts) Correctly deal with the terminating newline when
    parsing dependency lines.  Fixed bug#27694, reported by Rob Tillotson.
  * (checks/menu-format) Added Apps/Technical and Apps/Hamradio as sections.
  * (checks/copyright-file)
    Don't report copyright-file-is-gpl unless it is GPL version 2.
    This fixes bug#27793, reported by Milan Zamazal.
  * (checks/menus) Add newline after bad-menu-file-name tag!
  * (lib/manual_refs.pl) Update urls to manual sections, so that
    they refer to www.debian.org.  Regenerate index of devref sections.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 15 Oct 1998 14:06:26 +0200

lintian (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/html_reports, checks/*, collection/*)
    Make rigorous distinction between source and binary packages.
    Pass "source" or "binary" as second argument to check scripts.
    Report source package tags with "pkg source:" instead of just "pkg:".
    Binary package tags stay the same.
    (The check scripts always report "pkg type:", and the frontend strips
     the type again if it's "binary").
    This involves several changes in the web-report scripts as well.

  * Add command-line options for the things that could only be set via
    environment variables or the configuration file.  (--cfg, --root,
    --lab, --dist, --arch).

  * Really rename obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst to
    postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig.
  * Really rename changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package

  * (checks/scripts) bltwish now lives in blt8.0, not blt4.2.

lintian (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menu-format) Added "sort" as a known tag; it's documented in
    the menu package.  This fixes bug#26373, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)  Added /usr/bin/js as a known
    interpreter (in ngs-js), as suggested by Brian Bassett.

  * (checks/shared-libs)  Brian Bassett reported inaccuracies in detection
    of "ldconfig" calls in maintainer scripts.  Fixed.

  * (checks/menu-format)  Skip checks on "section" if the "needs" tag had an
    unknown value.  This deals with bug#26375, reported by Marcelo E. Magallon.

  * (checks/manpages)  Fixed: check for links to "undocumented" manpage
    should not react to link destinations like "ilu-undocumented".

  * changelog-file-missing-in-native-debian-package shortened to
    changelog-file-missing-in-native-package
  * wrong-name-for-changelog-file-of-native-debian-package shortened to
    wrong-name-for-changelog-of-native-package.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 10 Sep 1998 12:55:45 +0200

lintian (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ignore common programming-language extensions when looking for
    extra-license-files.  (Fixes bug#26252, reported by Manoj Srivastava,
    who had a file vm-license.el).

  * Use -z flag for tar, rather than piping through gzip -dc explicitly.
    This allows tar to detect and pass on errors reported by gzip.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  1 Sep 1998 11:57:53 +0200

lintian (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/bin/guile and /usr/bin/scsh as known interpreters.

  * Renamed tags:
       postinst-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-update-menus
       postrm-contains-obsolete-call-to-updatemenus

    to postrm-has-useless-call-to-install-docs
       obsolete-ldconfig-call-in-postinst
    to postinst-has-useless-call-to-ldconfig
    The first two are also downgraded from error to warning.
    (This fixes bug#26118, reported by Wichert Akkerman <wakkerma@debian.org>)

  * Renamed tag use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script to killall-is-dangerous.

  * More overrides.

lintian (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Don't emit warnings for perl scripts in /usr/doc.
    This closed bug#25728, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (info/overrides) Change the non-standard-*-perm overrides to match
    the new format of those tags.  (was changed in 0.7.5)

  * (checks/control-files)
    "possibly-insecure-handling-of-tmp-files-in-maintainer-script" now knows
    about mkdir.
    New tag: W: possible-bashism-in-maintainer-script (Suggestion by Joey Hess)

  * (testset/filenames-2)  Don't rely on installer's umask for testset.

  * (collection/menu-files, collection/menu-files.desc,
     checks/menu-format, checks/menu-format.desc)
    New check for correct syntax in "menu" files, written by Joey Hess.
    New tags:
      E: old-format-menu-file
      E: whitespace-after-continuation-character
      E: bad-test-in-menu-item
      E: unparsable-menu-item
      W: incorrect-package-test
      W: duplicated-tag-in-menu-item
      W: menu-item-missing-important-tag
      W: menu-item-contains-unknown-tag
      W: menu-item-uses-icon-none
      W: menu-item-needs-tag-has-unknown-value
      E: menu-item-adds-to-root-menu
      W: menu-item-uses-apps-games-section
      W: menu-item-creates-new-section
      E: menu-item-creates-new-root-section
    The check follows current practice on two sections:
      Window-managers -> WindowManagers
      Screen/Screen-saver -> Screen/Save
    The menu docs will be updated to match.

  * (lib/pipeline.pl) Bugfix: Use syscall SYS_exit when exiting from
    children that failed to exec, because the perl function exit() would
    run END blocks and such.

  * (checks/standards-version) By now, 2.2.0.0 is more than one year old;
    mark it as 'ancient'.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Bugfix: Apply quotehtml() to the tag text
    *before* adding links to bug pages.

  * Many small adjustments to checks:
  * (checks/scripts) Be less picky about package names when checking
    dependencies.  (The check was confused by the package blt4.2)
  * (checks/description) Ignore case when looking for synopsis lines
    that start with the package name.
  * (checks/files) Don't give executable-in-usr-doc error for executables
    in /usr/doc/examples/, since that directory does contain examples, and
    it's already flagged by old-style-example-dir.
  * (checks/control-files) Don't warn about references to "/tmp" unless the
    full filename is "/tmp" or "/var/tmp".
  * (checks/binaries) Split tag "binary-not-linked-against-libc" into
    "program" and "library" tags.
  * (checks/files, checks/scripts) New tag "executable-manpage", which
    replaces "executable-not-elf-or-script" for manpages.
  * (checks/files) Shortened file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
    and file-directly-in-usr-doc-not-in-a-sub-directory to just
    file-directly-in-usr-share and file-directly-in-usr-doc.
  * (checks/md5sums) Added md5sums-control-file-is-empty tag, to avoid
    spewing many file-missing-in-md5sums errors in that case.
  * (checks/scripts) Suppress interpreter-not-absolute tag if the
    filename ends in .in and the interpreter looks like #!@PERL@
  * (checks/control-files) Suppress mknod-in-maintainer-script tag if
    mknod was called with -p.
  * (checks/shared-libs) Emit no-shlibs-control-file tag for each shared lib
    found, rather than just once.
  * (checks/files) Emit old-style-example-dir only for directories, not for
    every file.
  * (checks/perl) perl-script-needs-dependency
    Bugfix: realize that a package does not need to depend on itself.
  * (checks/description) possible-unindented-list-in-extended-description:
    Only emit this tag if there are at least two things that look like
    list items.
  * (checks/scripts) List /usr/bin/env as a known interpreter.
  * (checks/binaries) unstripped-binary-or-object:
    Instead of an exception for /lib/modules specifically, suppress this
    tag for all .o files.
  * (checks/control-files) Bugfix: check for == bashism works now.
  * (checks/files) Introduced new tag lengthy-symlink, which supersedes
    and corrects the relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory tag.

  * (man/lintian.1) Document the check and collection scripts added to
    lintian in the last few months. (oops)

  * (collection/perlmods, checks/perl)
    Refined scanner so that fewer spurious perl-script-uses-unknown-module
    tags are emitted.
    Perl tags are no longer 'Experimental'.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Mon, 24 Aug 1998 18:01:40 +0200

lintian (0.7.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/perl) Exchanged order of arguments in
    perl-script-needs-dependency tag, for clarity.
  * (info/perl-modules) Added some module dependencies.

  * (info/overrides) More overrides.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/shared-libs.desc)
    Fixed: erroneous shlib-missing-in-control-file if a shared library
    had more than one symlink to it.
  * Renamed obsolete-shlib-entry-in-control-file to
    unused-shlib-entry-in-control-file.

  * (checks/copyright-file) Changed size-requirement for copyright-file-is-gpl
    tag from 17000 to 12000 bytes, because some packages (casio) extracted
    only the "TERMS AND CONDITIONS" part, which is shorter.

  * (reporting/html_reports) Count packages as well as tags, in tag index.

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: W: mknod-in-maintainer-script

  * (checks/files, checks/files.desc)
    New tags:
       W: package-installs-into-etc-rc.boot   (rc.boot is obsolete)
       W: extra-license-file                  (for COPYING files, etc)

  * (checks/shared-libs, frontend/lintian)
    Get rid of dependency on File::Basename; use a simple regexp instead.

lintian (0.7.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Fixed: perl script scanner is now POD-aware.
    This should cut down on the number of spurious warnings.

  * (doc/CREDITS)
    Install credits file.  My apologies if I have forgotten anyone.
    There were far more people than I would have guessed -- Thanks to all! :-)

  * (checks/perl)
    Skip 'autouse' keyword when parsing use and require directives.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    When processing a .changes file, turn md5sum checks OFF by default.
    A new -m flag is provided to turn them back on.
    The .dsc file is still always checked.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Saner interrupt handling.  Lintian now dies immediately if ^C is hit,
    and does remove the temporary lab (if any).  This is mostly a side
    effect of avoiding system() (in favour of the new functions in 
    lib/pipeline.pl), but did involve some tinkering about with perl's
    signal handling.  Thanks to Ruud de Rooij and Graydon Hoare for
    their help.  This closes bug#24975, reported by Yann Dirson.

  * (checks/copyright)
    Fixed copyright-is-gpl tag so that it actually works.

  * (lib/dep.pl, checks/perl, checks/perl.desc, info/perl-modules)
    Much smarter perl module analysis.  Lintian now has a list of
    perl modules and the packages that provide them (in info/perl-modules),
    and a dependency processor (in lib/dep.pl), and uses these to
    check "use" and "require" lines in perl scripts.
    New tags:
      W: perl-script-needs-dependency  (Experimental)
      W: perl-script-uses-unknown-module  (Experimental)
    Tag "script-needs-full-perl" has been dropped.

lintian (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Fixed: --display-infotags option wasn't working.

  * (reporting/harness, reporting/html_reports)
    Have the archive check generate infotags but not display them on the
    web pages.  This way they are still available in the log file.

  * (checks/fields, checks/fields.desc)
    New tag: W: doc-package-depends-on-main-package

  * (checks/menus, checks/menus.desc)
    New tag: E: bad-menu-file-name
    This is emitted for packages that install "/usr/lib/menu/menu", which
    overlaps with the menu package.  (I've seen it happen a couple of times).

  * (checks/binaries, checks/binaries.desc)
    Allow unstripped-binary-or-object for any package with "debug" in its
    name.  (This is in addition to the exeption already made for "-dbg").
    Allow binary-not-linked-against-libc for libc itself :-)

  * (lib/pipeline.pl)
    New helper functions for starting pipelines from perl scripts, without
    involving the shell.  This makes it easier to pass filenames literally,
    and often saves a shell invocation.
  * (collection/diffstat, frontend/lintian, unpack/*)
    Use the new pipeline functions.

  * (checks/description, checks/description.desc)
    New tag:
      E: description-is-debmake-template

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Quote < and > in displayed tags (such as occurs in email addresses).
    This fixes the maintainer-name-missing tag output.

  * (checks/copyright-file, checks/copyright-file.desc)
    New tag:
      E: copyright-file-is-gpl
    Generated for copyright files that contain the complete GPL text.

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: replaced system("mkdir ...") with mkdir() calls.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1)
    Speedup: avoid extracting control info twice.
    More speedups are possible here.
  * (unpack/unpack-binpkg-l1, unpack/unpack-binpkg-l2)
    Speedup: avoid using dpkg-deb to unpack debs; construct a pipeline
    with ar, gzip, and tar instead.  It turns out to be far faster.
  * Together, these changes made for a speed increase of some 30%
    when checking packages that have to be unpacked.

    Added /usr/bin/expect (provided by expect) as known interpreter.

  * (unpack/unpack-srcpkg-l2)
    Fixed: chmod -R the right directory when unpacking a source package.

  * (collection/diffstat, collection/diffstat.desc)
    New collection script that runs diffstat on the Debian diff.
  * (debian/control)
    Depend on diffstat, version >= 1.27-1 so that it can parse Debian diffs.
  * (checks/debdiff, checks/debdiff.desc)
    New check that look at the filenames included in the Debian diff.
    New tag:
      W: patch-failure-file-in-diff foo.rej

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    - Rewritten (more modular).
    - Create a page for each different tag, which gives the lintian-info
      for that tag and then lists all occurrences of that tag, with each
      tag line also being a link back to the page for the package in
      which it occurs.
      This closes bug#21390, reported by Gregory S. Stark <gsstark@mit.edu>.
    - Instead of listing the lintian-info text with every different tag
      in every package, make every tag a link to the page for that tag
      (which will have the lintian-info for it at the top).
      This should make the reports a lot smaller, and also more readable.
    - Make a "Sorted by tag types" page and link to it from the index page.
  * (doc/TODO) Entries [L3] and [L4] now complete.

  * (checks/spelling, checks/spelling.desc)
    Check README.Debian file as well, since we now collect it anyway
    for the readme-debian-is-debmake-template tag.
    New tag:
       E: spelling-error-in-readme-debian

  * (checks/fields) Added hurd-i386 to the list of known architectures, at
    the request of Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmds@rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de>.

  * (checks/scripts, checks/scripts.desc)
    Added trs to the list of known interpreters, as /usr/bin/trs provided
    by konwert.  Suggestion by Yann Dirson <dirson@debian.org>.  This
    closed bug#24998.

  * (checks/files)
    - Fixed: tags dir-in-user-local and file-in-usr-local did not print
      the filename involved.
    - Fixed: some tags were erroneously output as "setuid-gid-binary"
      even though only one of suid or sgid was set.

  * (checks/fields)
    - Fixed: change a few cases of "maintainer-address-malformed"
      to "maintainer-name-missing".

  * (checks/control-files, checks/control-files.desc)
    New tag: use-of-killall-in-maintainer-script (experimental)
    Added at the recommendation of Santiago Vila <sanvila@unex.es>.
    This closes bug#22206.

  * (depcheck/deppages.pl, reporting/html_reports)
    Added arm and hurd-i386 to the list of architectures to check.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt, checks/binaries.desc)
    Revamped doc file at Rob Browning's suggestion, and renamed it to
    doc/libtool-workarounds.txt because it describes both -rpath and -lc
    workarounds.  Updated the info for the tags binary-not-linked-against-libc
    and binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath to refer to the new file.

  * (doc/desc-files)  Moved from private/DESC.
    Briefly describes the meanings of the fields used in lintian's .desc files.

  * (doc/TODO)
    Updated and restructured version of what used to be in private/TODO,
    various bugreports and mailed suggestions.  This will become the 
    central place for potential improvements to lintian.  I hope that
    having it in /usr/doc/lintian will inspire some people to help.

    version info (thus ending in ".so") with a "non-dev-pkg-with-shlib-symlink"
    warning.

  * (info/overrides)  Added overrides:
    libtricks is like fakeroot; nothing is compiled with it.
      libtricks: no-shlibs-control-file
    slrnpull has been split off from slrn, and shares some of its overrides.
      slrnpull: non-standard-dir-perm var/spool/slrnpull/ 2755
      This fixes bug#24668, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (collection/perlmods)
    Collector script that greps perl scripts for use and require directives.
  * (checks/perl, checks/perl.desc)
    New check script that checks perl "use" and "require" directives.
    New tags:
       E: script-needs-perl-version   (Experimental)
       W: script-needs-full-perl      (Experimental)
       I: cannot-parse-perl-directive

  * (frontend/lintian)
    New flag --print-version that prints the unadorned version number.
  * (reporting/config, reporting/html_reports)
    Instead of requiring $LINTIAN_VERSION in the config file, query the
    lintian frontend for the version number.

lintian (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Lintian web pages now use dists/unstable/main in the path for
    "Getting Lintian", rather than hamm/hamm, where it doesn't exist anymore.
    (Pointed out by Ruud de Rooij)

  * (checks/scripts)
    Add /usr/sbin/install-fvwmgenmenu as a known interpreter.
    This fixes bug#23783, reported by Joost Kooij.

  * (checks/binaries, checks/changelog-file, checks/manpages)
    [speedup] Don't skip blank lines in file-info file, since there
    shouldn't be any.

  * (checks/manpages.desc)
    - Added note to manpage-in-wrong-directory info that only
      sections 1 through 9 should be used.  Refer to policy 5.1.
    I had a rewrite of the manpages check in the works, but I deferred
    it to a later lintian version.

  * (info/overrides)
    New override from Joel Klecker: binutils: no-shlibs-control-file.
    Added overrides supplied by Joey Hess, in bugreport #24425.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Corrected regexp used for changelog-file-not-compressed;
    This really fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

  * (checks/files)
    New warning: package-installs-perllocal-pod, inspired by 
    Manoj Srivasta's recent bugreports about such files.

  * (checks/fields.desc) 
    No longer experimental:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
      E: versioned-provides
      E: bad-version-in-relation

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun, 12 Jul 1998 22:04:04 +0200

lintian (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added overrides supplied by Ray Dassen.

  * (frontend/lintian-info)
    Made lintian-info aware of X (experimental) tags.  (oops)
  * (lib/read_taginfo.pl)
    Add a paragraph to the info output for experimental tags that explains
    what experimental status means.

  * Added test package "relationships" to test weird dependency lines.

  * (frontend/lintian)
    Instead of specifying /usr/bin/lintian-info, use just lintian-info
    and let the path search find the script.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Tue,  7 Jul 1998 16:27:56 +0200

lintian (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/menus) The menu package doesn't need to check for the
    existence of update-menus :-)

  * (testset/runtests) A harness for running regression tests on Lintian.
  * (testset/*) A collection of broken packages on which to test Lintian.
    Currently, only an empty package is provided for testing.
  * (debian/rules) Run the tests in the build target.
  * (checks/*.desc) Added "Tested: empty" to tags that are tested for
    with the "empty" testpackage.

  * (collection/file-info) Use a better parser for the index file, so
    that weird filenames are handled correctly.  This fixes bug#24079.
  * (collection/md5sums) Adapt index-file parser from file-info collector,
    this saves a "find" operation on the unpacked tree.
  * New test package filenames-1, which contains various evil filenames.

  * (checks/shared-libs, checks/menus, checks/manpages, checks/files,
     checks/control-files)
    Handle filenames that contain spaces correctly.

  * (frontend/lintian, reporting/config)
    Update version number.  This fixes bug #23555, reported by Yann Dirson.
    These will have to be kept in sync manually, because the lintian
    source package has to be directly usable by the lintian web page
    generator.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Allow the upstream changelog to be a symbolic link.
    As a side-effect, allow it for the Debian changelog too.
    This handles bug#23300, reported by Manoj Srivastava.

  * (checks/changelog-file, checks/changelog-file.desc)
    The wrong-name tags are now warnings, not errors, because the
    relevant section of policy uses "should usually".
    This fixes bug#23757, reported by Gregory S. Stark.

  * (checks/changelog-file)
    Limited the changelog-file-not-compressed tag to only complain
    about changelog and changelog.Debian, because policy 5.8 does not
    mention other changelogs.  (These would fall under section 5.3, I guess.)
    This fixes bug#23683, reported by Joey Hess.

lintian (0.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/fields)
    New error tag: "multiline-field" flags control fields that span multiple
    lines when they shouldn't.  (According to the Packaging manual,
    "Except where otherwise stated only a single line of data is allowed").

  * (checks/fields)
    Check dependency relationship fields as well.
    New tags:
      E: alternates-not-allowed
           (generated for use of | in Provides, Conflicts, and Replaces fields)
      E: versioned-provides
           (generated for Provides fields that use a versioned package name)
      W: obsolete-relation-form
           (generated for use of < and > in versioned relationships)
      W: bad-version-in-relation
           (generated if the version number in a versioned relation
            is not syntactically correct)
      E: bad-relation
           (generated if lintian cannot parse an element of a dependency line)
      W: package-relation-with-self

  * (checks/fields)
    Bugfix to maintainer-not-full-name tag, it works now.
    Added maintainer-address-looks-weird warning for obscure cases.
    I doubt anyone will ever see it.

  * (checks/fields)
    Added new-essential-package warning, to highlight such packages.

  * (checks/fields.desc) Descriptions of new tags.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sun,  7 Jun 1998 17:58:19 +0200

lintian (0.4.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed Christian's name wherever it appeared as a contact address.

  * (depcheck/buglist) Entered newly reported bug numbers for dependency 
    problems.

  * (checks/menus) Distinguish between install-docs and install-docs -r.
    (closes #23049).

  * (checks/files) Added new tag backup-file-in-package.  This warns
    about emacs-style backup files that got installed in a package.

  * (frontend/lintian) Allow I: tags to be overridden just like any other.

  * (frontend/lintian) Add support for "Experimental" tags.  These are
    handled like other tags, but an "Experimental: yes" flag in the tag
    description tells lintian to output them with "X:" rather than "E:"
    or "W:" or "I:".  This is used for new tags that might still misbehave.

  * (doc/lintian.sgml) Add a paragraph to explain the new tag type.
    "The displayed message is one of types listed above, but has been
     flagged as `experimental' by the Lintian maintainers.  This means
     that the code that generates this message is not as well tested as
     the rest of Lintian, and might still give surprising results.  Feel
     free to ignore Experimental messages that do not seem to make sense,
     though of course bug reports are always welcomed."

lintian (0.4.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * (debian/control)
    Lintian now depends on perl, since perl-base is not enough. It already
    uses Text::Wrap, which is only in perl, and soon it will also use
    Getopt::Long.

  * (reporting/html_reports)
    Report all dates in GMT, in rfc822 format.

  * (debian/rules)
    In clean target, delete byte-compiled python files (*.pyc) as well.

  * (depcheck/dependencies.py)
    Check "Cannot satisfy without packages in base" before checking
    "Cannot satisfy with required packages", because a dependency will
    be listed in only one category, and the former is more important
    to flag.

  * (frontent/lintian)
    Rewrote option handling to use Getopt::Long, thus allowing nifty
    features like bundling of single-character options.  Closes wishlist
    bug#22566.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Fri, 29 May 1998 11:25:31 +0200

lintian (0.4.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * (depcheck/) New directory, containing scripts for generating reports
    about broken dependency relationships in the main distribution.
    These are not installed by the lintian deb, they are intended for
    use by the lintian web pages, which use the source package directly.
  * (reports/harness) Added hooks to call the depcheck scripts to generate
    the depcheck page.
  * (reports/html_reports) Add links from the lintian root page to the
    depcheck page.

  * (checks/menus) A tag was still generating "existance" while its
    description had been corrected to "existence"; the html report
    generator complained about that.  Fixed.

  * (unpack/list-binpkg) Bugfix in lintian --setup-lab.  Instead of
    looking for files in binary-$arch and binary-all, look only in
    binary-$arch and follow the symlinks.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl) Changed "&maint;" name from Christian Schwarz
    to Richard Braakman, and changed mail address to lintian-maint@debian.org.

  * (checks/standards-version) If checking a package with a Standards-Version
    that is newer than the one lintian is written for, warn that lintian 
    should be upgraded.  (closes: #22919).
  * (checks/standards-version.dsc)
    New tag: newer-standards-version

  * (checks/debian-readme) New check: at James Troup's suggestion,
    scan for unmodified deb-make templates in README.Debian files.
    New tags:
      readme-debian-is-debmake-template
      readme-debian-contains-debmake-template
  * (checks/debian-readme.desc) Describe new tags.
  * (collection/debian-readme) New collection script for README.Debian file.
  * (man/lintian.1) Describe new check and collection script.

  * (doc/libtool-rpath-workaround.txt) Explain how to achieve the same
    result without touching configure.in and rerunning autoconf, provided
    certain conditions hold.

  * (lib/text_utils.pl, frontend/lintian-info, reporting/html_reports)
    Do not split words that are longer than a line.  This fixes the
    "Poli cy" bug in the lintian HTML reports.

  * (checks/standards-version.desc) Corrected the URL to Christian's
    policy upgrading checklist, which seems to have changed from
    "upgrading.html" to "upgrading-checklist.html".

  * (info/override) Removed another *.pm warning, I missed it the last time.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Thu, 28 May 1998 15:51:37 +0200

lintian (0.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * (checks/scripts) Suppress script-not-executable warnings for files
    in /usr/lib that match *.pm.  These are perl modules, which often
    have a #!/usr/bin/perl line at the top but are not intended to be
    executed directly.
  * (info/override) Removed now-suppressed warnings from the overrides file.

  * (info/override) Added more overrides.  (closes #21028).

  * (checks/scripts) At Oliver Elphick's suggestion, do not emit
    *-script-but-no-*-dep tags or csh-considered-harmful tags for
    scripts that are not executable.  (These already produce a
    script-not-executable warning).

  * (checks/binaries) At Yann Dirson's suggestion, added a tag for
    stripped binaries that still have the .comment and .note sections.
    This tag is info-level, thus not normally displayed.
    dh_strip and install -s have been patched to strip these sections,
    but most of the distribution has not been recompiled with the patched
    versions.
  * (checks/binaries.desc) Described the new tag.
    (closes #22495).

  * (man/lintian.1) Documented the options that were added in lintian 0.4.3.

  * (checks/fields) Produce informational tags no-section-field and
    no-priority-field.  These were removed in a previous version, because
    nearly all packages do not pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol when building
    packages, but the new handling of info-level tags makes them useful again.

 -- Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>  Sat, 16 May 1998 14:10:30 +0200

lintian (0.4.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Christian added more overrides.
  * debian/control: New maintainer.
  * debian/copyright: Mention that lintian has no separate upstream source.
  * debian/rules: Got rid of 'dirs' file.
  * Moved manpages from doc/ to man/ in source package.
  * debian/rules: Restyled :-)
  * New overrides, read all about them in /usr/share/lintian/info/overrides.
    (closes #22001)
  * Corrected typo in frontend, added --allow-root option at Johnie Ingram's
    suggestion to override lintian's refusal to run as root.  (closes #22162).
  * Ran ispell over .desc files, fixing lots of typos, including the
    word "existance" which occurs in several tags.
  * checks/files: At the advice of the python maintainer, added a warning
    against files installed in /usr/lib/python1.5 that are not in the
    site-packages subdirectory.  (closes #22236)
  * checks/fields: Reduced unknown-field-in-dsc and unknown-field-in-control
    tags from "warning" to "info", because such fields can only be
    introduced deliberately anyway.  ("info" tags are not normally reported,
    but can be queried when someone is interested.)  (closes #20521)
  * Made the above comment about info tags true, by adding a --display-info
    option.

lintian (0.4.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release contains updates for Policy 2.4.1

  * Fixed `changelog' check:
    - don't report not-max-compression tag if changelog file is a symbolic
      link (thanks to Santiago for noticing that! fixes:bug#20842)
  
  * Improved `description' check:
    - recognize if extended description is `Missing'
      (fixes:bug#21091)

  * Changed `files' check:
    - symbolic links within /etc and /var have to be relative!
  
  * Fixed `scripts' check:
    - package name is "blt4.2", not "btl4.2" :)

  * Updated `shared-libraries' check:
    - check if postinst calls ldconfig if shared libraries are installed
      in a directory controlled by ld.so
      (fixes:bug#20414)
    [2 new tags]   

  * Changed `standards-version' check:
    - added Standards-Version 2.4.1
    - only check first there digits of Standards-Version field
  
  * Changes to the `lintian' frontend:
    - unused overrides are displayed per package
    - display `Processing changes file...'
    - use $TMPDIR environment variable for creation of the temporary lab
      (fixes:bug#21092)
    - clean up lab if C-C is pressed
  
  * Added more overrides

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Tue,  7 Apr 1998 21:42:51 +0200

lintian (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes which make it possible to check the whole archive with Lintian
    each day without having to check all packages all the time:
    - Reworked creation and handling of info/{binary,source}-packages files:
      - the list files contain a version number now, which allows checking
        for old file formats
      - each entry has a timestamp now
      - don't remove $LAB/info/ directory on --setup-lab
      - just process changed packages when doing --setup-lab
    - added command line option: `-p X' makes lintian only process all
      packages which are listed in file X
    - changed meaning of command line option `-U': specifies info to
      collect _in addition to_ the usual info (necessary to extract
      the changelog files on master--see below)
 
  * Improved `binaries' check:
    - objects and binaries in a *-dbg package may be unstripped
    - libraries in lib/profile or lib/debug may not be stripped
      (suggested by Fabrizio)
    [1 new tag]
  
  * Added new `changelog' check
    (thanks to Juan Cespedes for the idea! fixes:bug#19695)

  * Improved `control-files' check:
    - improved RE that searches maintainer scripts for /tmp security bugs
  
  * Improved `description' check:
    - fixed RE to check for description-starts-with-package-name
      (thanks to Roderick Schertler)
  
  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - internal: check for source pkg using "-l dsc" instead of "-e dsc"
  
  * Fixed `files' check:
    - disabled possible-name-space-pollution tag since policy is not
      defined yet

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - fixed silly typo in binary-without-manpage tag info
      (thanks to Robert Edmonds for noticing that!)
    - disabled tag binary-without-manpage for `versioned binaries'
      (thanks to Dirk for the suggestion! fixes:bug#20186)
  
  * Fixed `menu' check:
    - report maintainer-script-does-not-check... tag only once per package
      and maintainer script
    - recognize `$(which update-menus)' as valid check for the existance
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Fabrizio for pointing this out!)
    - recognize `command -v update-menus' as valid check for the existance
      of update-menus; same for install-docs
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for pointing this out! fixes:bug#20759)
    - fixed tag infos
      (thanks to Adam P. Harris for the input! fixes:bug#19810)

  * Added `changelog' collector script
    This makes it possible for Lintian to extract all changelog files
    on master for use by Apt (fixes:bug#20546)

  * Incremented LAB_FORMAT version to 3 because of
    incompatible changes in the objdump-info collector script

    tags have not been handled correctly
  
  * Internal: html-reporting tool: don't chop of text after hash (#)

        dir-or-file-in-opt

  * Added overrides

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Mon, 16 Mar 1998 08:44:34 +0100

lintian (0.3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This is (intentionally) an `unstable' upload--we've decided to not
    include the lintian package in `frozen' since it doesn't make sense to
    maintain a `stable' and `unstable' version of a package in such an
    early state. The maintainers should get Lintian from the `unstable'
    distribution to check `frozen' uploads though.

  * Added `menus' check. This check checks for common mistakes WRT
    /usr/lib/menu and /usr/share/doc-base files.
    [16 new tags]

  * Fixed `shared-libs' check:
    - removed `shared-library-uses-its-soname' check since this produced
      way too many false alarms (thanks to David Engel for the input!)
  
  * Fixed `binaries' check:
    - skip `unstripped-binary-or-object' check for kernel modules
      (thanks to Michael Meskes for noticing that!)
    - fixed pattern which parses the `file' command's output to be able
      to handle files without info text correctly
      (thanks to James R. Van Zandt for pointing this out!)
    - mention in tag info that shared libs should be stripped with
      `--strip-unneeded' options (thanks to Brian for pointing this out!)

  * Improved `manpages' check:
    - check if manual pages are compressed with gzip -9
      (thanks to Holger Rusch for the idea!)
      [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check:
    - for files in /usr/doc:
      - executables may only be in /usr/doc/<something>/examples
      - files should be owned by root.root (thanks to Joey)
      - files should not be directly placed into /usr/doc/
  	(fixes:bug#19485)
    - no files may be installed into /tmp and /var/tmp
    - renamed file-directly-in-usr-share to
      file-directly-in-usr-share-not-in-a-sub-directory
      (thanks to Santiago) 
    - fix tag info for "symlink-should-be-absolute"
    [3 new tags]

  * Improved `description' check:
    - lists (starting with a dash or asterisk) have to be indented
      (thanks to cpb4@ukc.ac.uk for the idea and the patch!
      fixes:bug#19481) 
    [1 new tag]
  
  * Fixed `scripts' check:
    - packages with python scripts might depend on python or python-base
      (thanks to Gregor Hoffleit for pointing this out and to Richard for
      the patch! fixes:bug#19162)
    - remove wrong policy quotation for `script-not-executable' tag
  
  * Fixed `init.d' check:
    - ignore update-rc.d calls in preinst and postinst scripts, if
      "remove" option is specified (thanks to Roman Hodek and Herbert Xu
      for pointing this out--this change also removes a lot of other false
      alarms WRT update-rc.d calls)

  * Improved `control-files' check:
    - scan maintainer scripts for references to /tmp or TMPFILE since this
      might be insecure (thanks to Topi Miettinen for the help!)
    [1 new tag]

  * Improved `copyright-file' to issue a special error message if a
    symbolic link /usr/doc/foo refers to a directory outside of /usr/doc
    (thanks to Darren for pointing this out!)

  * Fixed `fields' check:
    - added architecture `arm' (thanks to Roman Hodek)

  * Fixed `lintian' frontend:
    - run lintian scripts with LC_ALL=C 
      (thanks to Yann for pointing this out! fixes:bug#19166)
    - changed handling of `#' comments: for comments in the overrides
      file, the hash (#) has to be in the first column
    - changed all tags which used `#' for comments
  
  * Fixed `lintian-info':
    - multiple HTML tags haven't been converted into text format in all
      cases 
    - preformatted text is now handled correctly
    - merged with code that produced the HTML reports
    - code much cleaner now
  
  * Improved Lintian's documentation:
    - fixed libtool/rpath workaround file: don't wrap long line
      (Thanks to Yann for pointing this out!)
    - stress in docs that the "lintian-maint@debian.org" address should
      be used to contact the lintian authors (thanks to Adrian Bridgett
      for pointing this out!)
  
  * Added more overrides (fixes:bug#19163)  

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Mar 1998 23:00:31 +0100

lintian (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `scripts' checks and collector, written by Richard. This check
    checks the #! lines of scripts in a package.
    [40 new tags]
  
  * Added `spelling' checks, written by Richard. This check searches
    the "Description:" field and the "copyright" file for common spelling
    errors (typos).
    [2 new tags]

  * Improved `files' check: No package should install files directly into
    /usr/share. 
    New tag:
      file-directly-in-usr-share  
  
  * Fixed `files' check WRT files in /usr/lib/sgml and
    /etc/emacs/site-start.d: 
      -	ignore directories and symbolic links when checking for correct
        file permissions
      - display permissions in octal format
    (fixes:bug#18866,#19026)
  
  * Fixed `control-files' check: really ignore `control' control file
  
  * Improved `lintian' frontend:
      - parse command line parameters before reading the configuration
        file. With that, `lintian -h' even works if the cfg file has
        errors.  (fixes:bug#19031)
      - issue a warning and ignore `-all' option if packages are specified
        at the same time (in older versions, this make lintian abort with
        an error message)
      - really check all packages listed in a .changes file
        (fixes:bug#18851)

  * Fixed `md5sums' check to handle file names with spaces correctly
  
  * Put conffile /etc/lintianrc back in (fixes:bug#19031)
  
  * Include information about libtool/rpath workaround by Yann Dirson
    (Thanks Yann!)
  
  * Added more overrides
  
  * Internal changes:
      - Each error tag has a (bug) `Severity' field now which can be used
        to file bug reports with the correct severity
      - Each helper script has an `Author' field now
      - Fixed `unused overrides' report

lintian (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lintian now also works without a configuration file and without
    a static laboratory!  (Since Lintian is so easy to use now, there
    are no excuses for not using it! ;-)

  * Changed handling of lab:
      - if no lab is specified, it is created dynamically by the
        `lintian' command (the average use does not have to worry
        about the lab anymore)
      - since the dynamically created lab is placed in /tmp, several
        users can run lintian at the same time without having to know
        of each other
      - the commands `lintian-setup' and `lintian-remove' have been
        removed (fixes: bug#18707).
      - a `static' laboratory can be created/updated or removed by
        specifying the `--setup-lab' or `--remove-lab' options for the
        `lintian' command
      - added a lot of sanity checks to make removal of lab less risky :)

  * Changed handling of configuration file:
      - configuration file is not necessary anymore
      - changed search path for the configuration file to:
          $LINTIAN_CFG/lintianrc
          $LINTIAN_ROOT/lintianrc
          $HOME/.lintianrc
          /etc/lintianrc
      - all configuration variables have reasonable defaults and can
        be overwritten by environment variables of the same name
      - removed configuration file /etc/lintianrc--the file is now
        installed as /usr/doc/lintian/lintianrc.example
      - renamed all configuration variables to LINTIAN_xxxx
      - relaxed syntax of configuration file. It's now also possible
        to use `~' and `$HOME' in the configuration file (fixes:
        bug#18559)
      - added LINTIAN_ARCH configuration variable so that Lintian
        handles distribution directories correctly if these contain
        several architectures

  * Changed parsing of command line arguments:
      - if a package name is specified (instead of a file), look for
        this package in the distribution directory and in the lab (in
        earlier version, only the distribution directory was searched
        for packages)
      - added `--all' option to check the whole distribution
        (in earlier version, this was the default operation)
      - removed buggy `-n' command line option (this option wasn't
        really useful anyways)
      - the `-h' option displays a short description of all available
        options now
      - debug option `-d' can be specified several times to increase
        the verbosity level
      - recognize `--' as the end of options on the command line

  * Improved overrides handling:
      - the override files does not include the leading `[EW]:'
        anymore
      - the parameters of an error tag may be omitted to disable
        a certain tag for a whole package
      - when checking the full distribution, unused overrides are
        displayed
      - cleaned up overrides file and added/removed a few overrides

  * Improved documentation:
      - there is now a `Lintian User's Manual' which explains how to
        setup and use Lintian to check ones packages, and which gives
        insight on the design issues behind Lintian
      - added a manual page for lintian-info (has been split off
        from lintian(1))
      - updated the documentation files and the example lintianrc file
      - merged QUICKSTART file into the README

  * Improved `binaries' check: check if a binary or shared library
    defines RPATH
    (Thanks to Ray Dassen for the suggestion! fixes: bug#18519)
    New tag:
      binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath

  * Improved `files' check:
     WRT symbolic links:
      - issue errors instead of warnings
      - links between different top-level directories should always be
        absolute
      - check for relative links which contain to many `../' segments
      - check for symbolic links which contain segments like `foo/../bar'
        (Thanks to Manoj for the patch and the ideas!)
     general:
      - some additional checks for wrong file permissions
    New tags:
      symlink-has-too-many-up-segments
      relative-symlink-enters-same-toplevel-directory
      symlink-contains-up-and-down-segments
      bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script (renamed)
      bad-permissions-for-etc-emacs-script
      executable-in-usr-lib-sgml

  * Fixed `control-files' check: check file permissions correctly;
    also check file owners of control files
    New tag:
      control-file-has-bad-owner

  * Fixed `copyright' check: check for package dependencies correctly
    (fixes: bug#18611)

  * Improved `conffiles' check: files in /var/lib/games should not be
    tagged as conffile, in general.
    New tag:
      score-file-may-not-be-conffile

  * Improved `manpages' check: files in /usr/X11R6/man/man6 usually
    indicate X11 games in the wrong directory.
    New tag:
      x11-games-should-be-in-usr-games

  * Fixed `init.d' check: skip comments in init.d file
    (Thanks to Joey for pointing this out!)

      - don't collect info for unselected collector scripts (internal bug)

  * Internal changes:
      - don't refer to package `ftp.debian.org' for bugs in the
        $LINTIAN_DIST directory--refer to package `general' instead
      - made list-binpkg and list-srcpkg more verbose
      - made lintian-info less verbose (don't give detailed info more
        than once)
      - create control-index file which lists all files in control.tar.gz
      - fix permissions in the lab after a package has been unpacked
      - chdir to lab dir before running the checker and collection
        scripts (this makes it easier to write checks in awk or even sh)
      - pass vars to helpers via environment
      - don't link static info/* files into lab
      - implemented dpkg_read_control to parse all controls
      - don't use dpkg-deb to get control information about a .deb
      - collection and checking scripts `registry' is now done dynamically
      - move tag descriptions from collector and checker scripts into
        separate `.desc' files
      - each base directory in the lab has a .lintian-status file now, which
        can be used to detect incompatible lab changes, for example
      - moved unused files and internal documents into a private/ directory
        of the source package
      - cleaned up code

lintian (0.2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added `fields' check for control fields. (That's the first check
    written by Richard--and it's all Perl!!! ;-)
    [32 new tags]

  * Added `binaries' check.
    [6 new tags]

  * Improved `shared-libraries' check:
      - use objdump instead of ldd and ldconfig
      - this should fix all problems where Lintian couldn't check
        python/perl dynamic objects, etc.
      - allow cross-checking of packages, e.g., to check non-i386 .debs
        on a i386 system (note, that this requires a multi-arch objdump)
      - recognize if the shared library uses its SONAME
    New tag:
      shared-library-uses-its-soname

  * Improved `control-files' check:
      - Don't check the `control' control file for correct
        permissions, because dpkg doesn't care and this file isn't
        installed on the systems anyways

  * Improved `files' check:
      - Games are allowed to be setgid games
      - svgalib programs are allowed to be setuid root
      - usually, files in /usr/doc/foo should not be executable
    New tag:
      executable-in-usr-doc

  * Fix bug in `manpages' check: symlinks in /usr/bin, etc. also need
    a manual page! (Thanks to Joey Hess for pointing this out!)

  * Use `.' instead of `source' in lintian-{remove,setup} /bin/sh scripts
    (fixes bug#18421)

  * Define default values for configuration variables in
    lintian-{remove,setup} scripts (fixes bug#18354)

  * Fix bug in `copyright-file' check: Don't report
    usr-doc-symlink-to-foreign-package if we don't know whether the
    referenced package comes from the same source or not.
    (Thanks to James A. Treacy for pointing this out!)

  * Internal change:
      - process source packages before binary packages so that a binary
        package check can use info from the source packages (if these
        are unpacked, too)

  * Added more override entries--and removed a few obsolete entries
    (the checks are smarter now! :)

  * Added "Depends: binutils" for `objdump'

  * Changed maintainer email address to lintian-maint@debian.org

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Feb 1998 22:39:46 +0100

lintian (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed manual-pages check: Check for the `undocumented' symbolic
    link failed on X11 manual pages (fixes #18343).

  * Improved files check. New tag:
      etc-cron.d-script-tagged-executable

  * Improved control-files check:
      - the `du' control file is not allowed anymore
      - check file permissions of control files
    New tags:
      control-file-has-bad-permissions

  * Fixed bug: ldd-info collection script stopped when ldd failed

  * Fixed (internal) bugs:
      - collect data for collection scripts too
      - don't collect init.d data every time again

  * Error handling code improved again :)

  * The lintian frontend script checks if it has root permissions and
    aborts if this is the case. (Running it as root is unnecessary and
    simply too dangerous.)

  * Added one override entry

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 21:50:16 +0100

lintian (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in lintian-setup: don't try to create $LAB if it already
    exists (fixes bug#18227, bug#18252)

  * Added "Depends: file" (oops!)

  * Rewrote package "Description:"

  * Added a lot more override entries (thanks to all that told me about
    overrides!)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Feb 1998 12:55:58 +0100

lintian (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug in ldconfig collection script: script aborted without
    error message if a shared library had errors (thanks to Kai!)

  * Fixed bug: `standards-version' check didn't collect necessary data
    (actually, this was a more general bug--thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Fixed bug: init.d checker script didn't notice if several of the
    required options (start, stop, etc.) have been included on a single
    line (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Don't check duplicated packages more than once (thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Error handling code improved once more

  * Added more overrides (Thanks to Joey Hess!)

  * Mentioned Lintian's home page in the README file

  * Set package priority to `optional' (requested by several developers)

 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Feb 1998 11:44:32 +0100

lintian (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * First public release

  * Fixed bug in shlibs check: Sometimes, ldconfig doesn't install any
    symbolic links at all (e.g., for `acroread' package).

  * Changed lintian-setup: Don't remove the whole lab if it already 
    exists--just remove the info/ directory.

  * Changed handling of critical Lintian errors (abort on error)

  * Built package using fakeroot (first time i tried fakeroot--it's great!!)

  * Checked package with latest Lintian :)
  
 -- Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Feb 1998 21:49:10 +0100

lintian (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Next beta release (hopefully the last one :-)

  * The lintian-info script is available now! You can either pipe the output
    of lintian through it, or specify the `-i' option when calling lintian.

  * Lintian can check .changes files now! New tags:
      bad-distribution-in-changes-file
      file-size-mismatch-in-changes-file
      md5sum-mismatch-in-changes-file
      bad-section-in-changes-file

  * Lintian now detects if packages have been changed, even if they
    have the same version number as before.

  * Improved shlibs check (this fixes the "error: bad ldconfig-info file"
    bug). New tags:
      ldconfig-symlink-referencing-wrong-file
      ldconfig-symlink-is-not-a-symlink

  * Improved files check! New tags:
      package-installs-into-etc-rc.d
      non-standard-file-permissions-for-etc-init.d-script

  * New check for /etc/init.d scripts! Tags:
