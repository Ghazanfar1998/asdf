 .
  $ iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 file &gt; file.new
  $ mv file.new file

Tag: testsuite-dependency-has-unparsable-elements
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Lintian cannot parse the Depends field for the given autopkgtest.
 .
 Please double check that dependency the syntax is correct.
 .
 Note that Lintian has a whitelist of known "special" dependencies
 permitted by autopkgtest (e.g. @builddep@).  Lintian does not accept
 these as a part of an OR-clause.
 .
 If Lintian complains about a new special "@"-dependency, please file
 a bug against Lintian and have it added to the whitelist.

Tag: testsuite-autopkgtest-missing
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Info: This package does not declare a test suite. Having a test suite helps with
 automated QA in response to changes in the archive. For example, if your
 package has a test suite, it is possible to re-execute that test suite when
 any of the package dependencies has a new version and check whether that
 update caused problems for your package.
 .
 To declare a test suite, please add a <tt>debian/tests/control</tt> file to
 your package.
 .

 https://ci.debian.net/doc/.

Tag: unnecessary-testsuite-header
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: You do not need to specify a <tt>Testsuite</tt> field if a
 <tt>debian/tests/control</tt> file exists. It is automatically added by
 dpkg-source(1) since dpkg 1.17.1.
 .
 Please remove this line from your <tt>debian/control</tt> file.
