Check-Script: binaries
Author: Christian Schwarz <schwarz@debian.org>
Abbrev: bin
Standards-Version: 3.2.0
Type: binary, udeb
Unpack-Level: 1
Needs-Info: objdump-info, file-info
Info: This script checks binaries and object files for bugs.

Tag: arch-independent-package-contains-binary-or-object
Type: error
Info: The package contains a binary or object file but is tagged
 `Architecture: all'.

Tag: unstripped-binary-or-object
Type: error
Info: The package installs an unstripped binary or object file.
 .
 Please note, that shared libraries have to be stripped with the
 <tt>--strip-unneeded</tt> option.
 .
 Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact &maint;
 about this so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of
 Lintian.

Tag: library-in-debug-or-profile-should-not-be-stripped
Type: error
Info: Libraries in <tt>.../lib/debug</tt> or in
 <tt>.../lib/profile</tt> usually should not be stripped.

Tag: statically-linked-binary
Type: error
Info: The package installs a statically linked binary or object file.
 .
 Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact &maint;
 about this so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of
 Lintian.

Tag: library-not-linked-against-libc
Type: warning
Info: The package installs a library which is not dynamically linked
 against libc.
 .
 Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact &maint;
 about this so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of
 Lintian.

Tag: program-not-linked-against-libc
Type: warning
Info: The package installs a binary which is not dynamically linked
 against libc.
 .
 Usually this is a bug. Otherwise, please contact &maint;
 about this so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of
 Lintian.

Tag: libc5-binary
Type: warning
Info: The package contains a binary or shared library which is linked
 against libc.so.5.
 .
 This could be a bug since all programs in Debian should use
 libc6. However, the packages in the oldlibs section might contain
 libc5 libs/binaries intentionally. In that case, please send a note to
 &maint; so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of
 Lintian.

Tag: binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath
Type: warning
Info: The binary or shared library defines the `RPATH'. Usually this
 is a bad thing.  Most likely you will find a Makefile with a line like:
     gcc test.o -o test -Wl,--rpath
 or
     gcc test.o -o test -R/usr/local/lib
 Please contact &debdev; if you have questions about this.

Tag: binary-has-unneeded-section
Type: warn
Info: The binary or shared library is stripped, but still contains a
 section that is not useful.  The utilities (<tt>install -s</tt>
 and <tt>dh_strip</tt>) are patched to remove the <tt>.note</tt> and
 <tt>.comment</tt> sections.

Tag: missing-depends-line
Type: warning
Info: The package contains an ELF binary with dynamic dependencies,
 but does not have a Depends line in its control file.  This usually
 means that a call to <tt>dpkg-shlibdeps</tt> is missing from the
 package's <tt>debian/rules</tt> file.

Tag: shared-lib-without-dependency-information
Type: warning
Info: The listed shared library doesn't include information about which
 other libraries the library was linked against. (When running `<tt>ldd
 foo.so</tt>' ldd should report about these other libraries. In your
 case, ldd just reports `statically linked'.)
 .
 To fix this, you should explicitly specify the libraries which are
 used (e.g., `-lc') when building the shared library with `ld'.
 .
 If you have questions about this, please contact &debdev;.

Tag: compiled-with-bad-libc
Type: error
Info: This file defines or requires `__register_frame_info' as a dynamic
 symbol, and is not linked with libstdc++.  This means that it was
 compiled with a buggy version of libc.  It should be recompiled with
 the fixed versions, libc6 2.0.7u-6 or higher.  (which may not yet be
 available; see debian-devel).
 .
 This was a problem in the second half of 1998.  If you get this tag
 much later than that, it may be a different problem.  Please check
 with the lintian maintainer in that case.

Tag: arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share
Type: error
Info: This package installs an ELF binary in the <tt>/usr/share</tt>
 hierarchy, which is reserved for architecture-independent files.

Tag: binary-in-etc
Type: error
Info: This package installs an ELF binary in <tt>/etc</tt>.
 The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard forbids this.

Tag: binary-compiled-with-profiling-enabled
Type: warning
Info: While profiling is useful for testing and debugging purposes, enabling
 it causes a program to leave gmon.out files whenever a user runs it.

Tag: binary-file-compressed-with-upx
Type: error
Info: Debian does not allow binaries to be compressed by UPX.

Tag: binary-or-shlib-with-obsolete-c++-abi
Type: warning
Info: There is no CXXABI_* mark in the objdump output on this file,
 and it is linked against a libstdc++, meaning it's likely linking to
 an obsolete version of the C++ library.
