Tag: debian-rules-is-symlink
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The file <tt>debian/rules</tt> is a symlink instead of a regular
 file. This is unnecessary and makes package checking and manipulation
 more difficult. If the rules file should be available in the source
 package under multiple names, make <tt>debian/rules</tt> the real
 file and the other names symlinks to it.
 .
 This problem may have prevented Lintian from performing other checks,
 leading to undetected changelog errors.

Tag: debian-rules-not-a-makefile
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.9
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package does not appear to
 be a makefile or does not start with the required line.
 <tt>debian/rules</tt> must be a valid makefile and must have
 "<tt>#!/usr/bin/make -f</tt>" as its first line.

Tag: debian-rules-missing-required-target
Severity: serious
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.9
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package does not provide one
 of the required targets.  All of build, binary, binary-arch,
 binary-indep, and clean must be provided, even if they don't do anything
 for this package.

Tag: debian-rules-missing-recommended-target
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.9
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package does not provide
 one of the recommended targets.  All of build-arch and build-indep
 should be provided, even if they don't do anything for this package.
 If this package does not currently split building of architecture
 dependent and independent packages, the following rules may be added
 to fall back to the build target:
 .
   build-arch: build
   build-indep: build
 .
 Note that the following form is recommended however:
 .
   build: build-arch build-indep
   build-arch: build-stamp
   build-indep: build-stamp
   build-stamp:
   	build here
 .
 These targets will be required by policy in the future, so should be
 added to prevent future breakage.

Tag: debian-rules-missing-good-practice-target-dfsg
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.9, devref 6.7.8.2
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package does not provide
 one of the good practice targets.
 .
 If your packaged is repacked from non-dfsg source, you should add a
 get-orig-source target.

Tag: debian-rules-uses-deprecated-makefile
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package appears to
 include a Makefile that has been deprecated.  Please refer to the
 documentation of the providing package for a replacement (if any).

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-use-pwd
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package appears to use the
 variable $(PWD) to refer to the current directory.  This variable is not
 set by GNU make and therefore will have whatever value it has in the
 environment, which may not be the actual current directory.  Some ways of
 building Debian packages (such as through sudo) will clear the PWD
 environment variable.
 .
 Instead of $(PWD), use $(CURDIR), which is set by GNU make, ignores the
 environment, and is guaranteed to always be set.

Tag: debian-rules-ignores-make-clean-error
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: A rule in the <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package calls the
 package's clean or distclean target with a line like:
 .
  -$(MAKE) distclean
 or
  $(MAKE) -i distclean
 .
 The leading "-" or the option -i tells make to ignore all errors.
 Normally this is done for packages using Autoconf since Makefile may not
 exist.  However, this line ignores all other error messages, not just
 the missing Makefile error.  It's better to use:
 .
  [ ! -f Makefile ] || $(MAKE) distclean
 .
 so that other error messages from the clean or distclean rule will still
 be caught (or just remove the "-" if the package uses a static makefile).

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-use-DEB_BUILD_OPTS
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The standard environment variable for build options is
 DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Usually, referring to DEB_BUILD_OPTS is a mistake and
 DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS was intended instead.

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-use-DH_EXTRA_ADDONS
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The DH_EXTRA_ADDONS variable is designed for local or downstream build
 use and not for use in debian/rules
 .
 dh(1)'s <tt>--with</tt> should be used instead.

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-automatically-update-control
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Info: DEB_AUTO_UPDATE_DEBIAN_CONTROL appears to be set to <tt>yes</tt> in
 the <tt>debian/rules</tt> file.  This activates a feature of CDBS which
 may not be used in packages uploaded to the Debian archive.
Ref: https://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html

Tag: debian-rules-sets-DH_COMPAT
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: debhelper(7)
Info: As of debhelper version 4, the DH_COMPAT environment variable is
 only to be used for temporarily overriding <tt>debian/compat</tt>.  Any
 line in <tt>debian/rules</tt> that sets it globally should be deleted and
 a separate <tt>debian/compat</tt> file created if needed.

Tag: debian-rules-sets-DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dpkg-buildflags(1)
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file sets the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS variable,
 which will override any user-specified build profile.
 .
 Please replace with DH_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS.

Tag: binary-arch-rules-but-pkg-is-arch-indep
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: It looks like you try to run code in the binary-arch target of 
 <tt>debian/rules</tt>, even though your package is architecture-
 independent.

Tag: debian-rules-calls-debhelper-in-odd-order
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: One of the targets in the <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this
 package calls debhelper programs in an odd order.  Normally,
 dh_makeshlibs should be run before dh_shlibdeps or dh_installdeb, and
 dh_shlibdeps should be run before dh_gencontrol.  dh_builddeb should be
 the last debhelper action when building the package, after any of the
 other programs mentioned.  Calling these programs in the wrong order may
 cause incorrect or missing package files and metadata.

Tag: missing-build-dependency
Severity: serious
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 4.2
Info: The package doesn't specify a build dependency on a package that is
 used in <tt>debian/rules</tt>.
 .
 Lintian intentionally does not take into account transitive dependencies.
 Even if the package build-depends on some package that in turn
 depends on the needed package, an explicit build dependency should
 be added.  Otherwise, a latent bug is created that will appear without
 warning if the other package is ever updated to change its dependencies.
 Even if this seems unlikely, please always add explicit build
 dependencies on every non-essential, non-build-essential package that is
 used directly during the build.

Tag: missing-python-build-dependency
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 4.2
Info: The package appears to use Python as part of its build process in
 <tt>debian/rules</tt> but doesn't depend on Python.
 .
 Normally, packages that use Python as part of the build process should
 build-depend on one of python, python-all, python-dev, or python-all-dev
 depending on whether they support multiple versions of Python and whether
 they're building modules or only using Python as part of the package
 build process.  Packages that depend on a specific version of Python may
 build-depend on the appropriate pythonX.Y or pythonX.Y-dev package
 instead.

Tag: clean-should-be-satisfied-by-build-depends
Severity: important
Certainty: certain
Ref: policy 7.7
Info: The specified package is required to run the clean target of
 <tt>debian/rules</tt> and therefore must be listed in Build-Depends, not
 Build-Depends-Indep, even if no architecture-dependent packages are
 built.

Tag: debian-rules-makemaker-prefix-is-deprecated
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: perl-policy 4.3
Info: The package appears to use an <tt>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</tt>
 (Makefile.PL) build system and sets the temporary installation path by
 overriding <tt>PREFIX</tt> when calling <tt>make install</tt>.  This only
 works because of a Debian-specific change to <tt>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</tt>
 that the maintainers of the Debian perl package intend to remove.
 .
 The correct way to set the installation directory is with DESTDIR.
 Setting PREFIX should not be necessary at all.
 .
 For example, the line
   make install PREFIX=$(TMP)/usr          # WRONG
 should be replaced with
   make install DESTDIR=$(TMP)             # RIGHT

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-use-or-modify-user-only-variable
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: #631786
Info: The rules file appears to be reading or modifying a variable not
 intended for use by package maintainers.
 .
 The special variables <tt>DEB_*FLAGS_{SET,APPEND}</tt> can be used by
 users who want to re-compile Debian packages with special (or
 non-standard) build flags.
 .
 Please use the <tt>DEB_*FLAGS_MAINT_{SET,APPEND}</tt> flags instead.

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-use-underscore-variable
Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Ref: policy 4.9
Info: The rules file use the make variable $(_).
 .
 According to Policy 4.9, 'invoking either of <tt>make -f debian/rules
 &lt;...&gt;</tt> or <tt>./debian/rules
 &lt;args...&gt;</tt>' must result in identical behavior'.
 One way to inadvertently violate this policy is to use the $_ variable.
 .
 If the rules file uses $(dir $(_)) to discover the directory containing
 the source package (presumably in order to implement the get-orig-source
 target), please replace it by $(dir $(firstword $(MAKEFILE_LIST))).

Tag: debian-rules-parses-dpkg-parsechangelog
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: The rules file appears to be parsing the output of dpkg-parsechangelog to
 determine the current package version name, version, or timestamp, etc.
 .
 Since dpkg 1.16.1, this could be replaced by including the
 /usr/share/dpkg/pkg-info.mk Makefile library and using the
 DEB_{SOURCE,VERSION} or SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH variables.
 .
 Using this library is not only cleaner and more efficient, it handles many
 corner-cases such as binNMUs, epoch versions, etc.

Tag: debian-rules-sets-dpkg-architecture-variable
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dpkg-architecture(1)
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file sets one or more
 <tt>dpkg-architecture</tt> variables such as <tt>DEB_BUILD_ARCH</tt>.
 .
 These variables are pre-initialized in the environment when running under
 <tt>dpkg-buildpackage</tt> - avoiding these assignments can reduce package
 build time.
 .
 Please use:
 .
   include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk
 .
 instead, or replace the assignment operator with <tt>?=</tt>.

Tag: debian-rules-should-not-set-CFLAGS-from-noopt
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Ref: dpkg-buildflags(1)
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package appears to set
 <tt>CFLAGS</tt> if the value of <tt>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS</tt> contains
 <tt>noopt</tt>.
 .
 This has been obsoleted in favour of <tt>dpkg-buildflags</tt>.

Tag: override_dh_clean-does-not-call-dh_clean
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package has an
 <tt>override_dh_clean</tt> target that does not reference <tt>dh_clean</tt>.
 .
 This can result in packages not cleaning up properly via <tt>debian/rules
 clean</tt>.
 .
 Please add a call to <tt>dh_clean</tt>.
Ref: #884419, #884815

Tag: override_dh_fixperms-does-not-call-dh_fixperms
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package has an
 <tt>override_dh_fixperms</tt> target that does not reference
 <tt>dh_fixperms</tt>.
 .
 This can result in packages inheriting the <tt>umask(2)</tt> of the build
 process, rendering the package unreproducible.
 .
 Please add a call to <tt>dh_fixperms</tt>.
Ref: #885909

Tag: xz-compression-level-too-high
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package has a call to
 <tt>dh_builddeb(1)</tt> that specifies an overly eager xz(1) compression
 level.
 .
 Whilst higher levels might reduce the size of big files, it has the side
 effect of consuming a lot of memory during both compression and
 extraction.
 .
 This can not only also waste time unnecessarily, it can cause packages to
 FTBFS or even fail to install in resource-constrained environments or
 architectures.
 .
 Please remove the call and let dpkg-deb(1) select suitable defaults.
Ref: #829100, dpkg-deb(1)

Tag: override_dh_auto_test-does-not-check-DEB_BUILD_PROFILES
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: possible
Info: The <tt>debian/rules</tt> file for this package has an
 <tt>override_dh_auto_test</tt> target that does not appear to
 check <tt>DEB_BUILD_PROFILES</tt> against <tt>nocheck</tt>.
 .
 As this check is not automatically performed by debhelper(1), the
 specified testsuite is run regardless of using the <tt>nocheck</tt>
 build profile.
 .
 Please add a check such as:
 .
  override_dh_auto_test:
  ifeq (,$(filter nocheck,$(DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS)))
          ./run-upstream-testsuite
  endif
