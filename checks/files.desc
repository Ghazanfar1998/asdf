Tag: old-app-defaults-directory
Type: error
Info: The app-defaults files have moved to /etc/X11/app-defaults/. Files in
 the old directory, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/, will no longer be
 used by X. The old directory should not exist in packages at all;
 this prevents X from replacing it with a compatability symlink.

Tag: possible-name-space-pollution
Type: warning
Info: The package installs a binary which uses a very short file name (one
 or two characters). This is not forbidden by policy, but short names
 should be reserved for the user.  Unless this short name has been used
 for a while already (like the famous `ls', `rm', `cp' commands), you
 should consider giving these binaries a longer name.
 .
 If you think that the short name is ok, please send a note to &maint;
 so that this exception would be recognized in future versions of Lintian.

 is <tt>/usr/share/doc/<i>pkg</i>/examples</tt>.

Tag: gzipped-symlink-with-wrong-ext
Type: error
Info: The package installs a symbolic link pointing to a compressed file,
 but the symbolic link does not use the same file extension than the

Tag: symlink-has-too-many-up-segments
Type: error
Info: The symlink references a directory beyond the root directory `/'.

Tag: lengthy-symlink
Type: warning

 if the user's system has lots of symlinked directories.
Ref: policy 10.5

Tag: symlink-contains-up-and-down-segments
Type: error
Info: The symbolic link goes up and down.
Ref: policy 10.5

Tag: bad-permissions-for-etc-cron.d-script

Type: error
Info: Files in the <tt>/etc/emacs*</tt> directories should not be marked
 executable.

Tag: image-file-in-usr-lib

Info: Debian packages should not install into <tt>/opt</tt>, because it
 is reserved for add-on software.

Tag: third-party-package-in-python-dir
Type: warning
Info: According to <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/packages.html">
 <tt>http://www.python.org/doc/essays/packages.html</tt></a>, third-party
 python packages should install their files in

 <tt>/usr/lib/python1.5</tt> are for use by the core python packages.
 
Tag: perl-module-in-core-directory
Type: error
Info: Packaged modules must not be installed into the core perl
 directories as those directories change with each upstream perl
 revision.  The vendor directories are provided for this purpose.
Ref: perl-policy 3.1

Tag: backup-file-in-package
Type: warning
Info: There is a file in the package that matches the format emacs uses
 for backup and autosave files.  It may have been installed by accident.

Tag: package-installs-perllocal-pod
Type: warning
Info: This package installs a file <tt>perllocal.pod</tt>.  Since that
 file is intended for local documentation, it is not likely that it is
 a good place for documentation supplied by a Debian package.  In fact,
 installing this package will wipe out whatever local documentation
 existed there.

Tag: extra-license-file
Type: warning
Ref: policy 12.5
Info: All license information should be collected in the
 <tt>debian/copyright</tt> file.  This usually makes it unnecessary
 for the package to install this information in other places as well.

Tag: non-standard-toplevel-dir
Type: error
Info: The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard forbids the installation of new
 files or directories in the root directory, in section 3.

Tag: subdir-in-bin
Type: error

 directories in <tt>/bin</tt>.

Tag: non-standard-dir-in-usr
Type: warning

 subdirectory under the <tt>/usr</tt> hierarchy".  This package contains
 a directory in <tt>/usr</tt> that is not mentioned in the Filesystem
 Hierarchy Standard.

Tag: non-standard-dir-in-var
Type: error
Info: The FHS says "Applications should generally not add directories to
 the top level of <tt>/var</tt>.  Such directories should only be added
 if they have some system-wide implication, and in consultation with the
 FHS mailing list."

Tag: use-of-compat-symlink
Type: error
Info: This package uses a directory that, according to the Filesystem
 Hierarchy Standard, should exist only as a compatibility symlink.
 Packages should not traverse such symlinks when installing files, they
 should use the standard directories instead.

Tag: file-in-unusual-dir
Type: warning
Info: This file or symbolic link is in a directory where files are not
 normally installed by Debian packages.  If this is deliberate, please
 contact &maint; to make Lintian accept this as a usual directory.

Tag: package-installs-packlist
Type: error
Info: Packages built using the perl MakeMaker package will have a file
 named .packlist in them.  Those files are useless, and (in some cases)
 have the additional problem of creating an architecture-specific
 directory name in an architecture-independent package.
 .
 They can be suppressed by adding the following to <tt>debian/rules</tt>:
 .
 <tt>find debian/tmp -type f -name .packlist | xargs rm -f</tt>
 .
 <tt>-find debian/tmp/usr/lib/perl5 -type d -empty | xargs rmdir -p</tt>
 .
 Or by telling MakeMaker to use vendor install dirs; consult a recent
 version of perl policy. Perl 5.6.0-12 or higher supports this.

Tag: zero-byte-file-in-doc-directory
Type: warning
Info: Package contains a file which is empty.

Tag: override-file-in-wrong-location
Type: error
Info: Location of per package overrides the file
 /usr/share/lintian/overrides/package.  See the lintian documentation for more
 info on proper naming and format.

Tag: package-contains-upstream-install-documentation
Type: warning
Ref: policy 12.3
Info: Binary packages do not need to contain the instructions for building
 and installing the package as this info is not needed by package users.
 If the info contained is important for configuration perhaps it could be
 summarized in README.Debian, otherwise an override may be added.

Tag: xresources-file-in-etc-without-proper-conflicts
Type: error
Ref: policy 11.8.6
Info: Packages that install files into the /etc/X11/Xresources/ directory must
 declare a conflict with xbase (<< 3.3.2.3a-2); if this is not done it is
 possible for the installing package to destroy a previously-existing
 /etc/X11/Xresources file which had been customized by the system
 administrator.

Tag: package-contains-hardlink
Type: warning
Info: Hardlinks are bad mkay, don't use hardlinks.

Tag: package-contains-CVS-dir
Type: error
Info: Package contains a CVS directory. It was most likely installed by
 accident, since transient CVS data usually doesn't belong in packages.

Tag: package-contains-svn-control-dir
Type: error
Info: Package contains a .svn directory. It was most likely installed by
 accident, since Subversion version control directories usually don't belong
 in packages.

Tag: package-contains-xvpics-dir
Type: error
Info: Package contains a .xvpics directory. It was most likely installed by
 accident, since thumbnails usually don't belong in packages.

Tag: cvsignore-file-in-package
Type: warning
Info: Package contains a '.cvsignore' file.  It may have been installed by
 accident.

Tag: svn-commit-file-in-package
Type: warning
Info: Package contains a 'svn-commit(.NNN).tmp' file.  This file is almost
 certainly a left-over from a failed Subversion commit, and does not belong
 in a Debian package.

Tag: nested-examples-directory
Type: error
Info: Package contains a <tt>usr/share/doc/something/examples/examples</tt>
 directory. It was most likely installed by accident, since one examples/
 directory should be enough for everybody(tm).

Tag: package-installs-nonbinary-perl-in-usr-lib-perl5
Type: warning
Info: Architecture-independent Perl code should be placed in
 <tt>/usr/share/perl5</tt>, not <tt>/usr/lib/perl5</tt>.
