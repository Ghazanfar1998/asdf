Tag: new-package-should-not-package-python2-module
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to be the initial packaging of a new upstream
 software package (ie. it contains a single changelog entry). However, it
 ships a module for Python 2.
 .
 Python 2.x modules should not be packaged unless strictly necessary (such
 as being explicitly requested by an end-user or required as part of a
 dependency chain) as the 2.x series of Python is due for deprecation and
 will not be maintained past 2020.
 .
 If upstream have not moved or have no intention to move to Python 3,
 please be certain that Debian would benefit from the inclusion, continued
 maintenance burden and (eventual) removal of this package before you
 upload.
 .
 This warning can be ignored if the package is not intended for Debian or
 if it is a split of an existing Debian package.
 .
 Please add a justification to your changelog entry; Lintian looks in this
 version's changelog entry for the relevant package name or the phrase
 "Python 2 version" or similar.

Tag: python-foo-but-no-python3-foo
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This source package appears to generate the specified Python 2 package
 without creating a variant for Python 3.
 .
 The 2.x series of Python is due for deprecation and will not be maintained
 past 2020.
 .
 If upstream have not moved or have no intention to move to Python 3, please
 be certain that Debian would benefit from the continued inclusion of this
 package and, if not, consider removing it.
 .
 Alternatively, ensure that the corresponding package specifies the
 <tt>${python3:Depends}</tt> substvar in its binary depedencies.

Tag: build-depends-on-python-sphinx-only
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package Build-Depends on the Python 2.x version of the Sphinx
 documentation generator.
 .
 The 2.x series of Python is due for deprecation and will not be maintained
 past 2020.
 .
 Some Python modules may need to depend on both <tt>python-sphinx</tt> and
 <tt>python3-sphinx</tt> but please consider moving to only Build-Depending on
 the <tt>python3-sphinx</tt> package instead.

Tag: alternatively-build-depends-on-python-sphinx-and-python3-sphinx
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package alternatively Build-Depends on the Python 2 or Python 3
 version of the Sphinx documentation generator.
 .
 The 2.x series of Python is due for deprecation and will not be maintained
 past 2020.
 .
 Please replace the alternative with a single build dependency on
 <tt>python3-sphinx</tt>.

Tag: dependency-on-python-version-marked-for-end-of-life
Severity: wishlist
Certainty: certain
Ref: https://wiki.debian.org/Python/Python3Port, https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/
Info: The package specifies a dependency on Python 2.x which is due for
 deprecation and will not be maintained past 2020.
 .
 Please port the package to use Python 3 instead or ask upstream to do so.
 .
 If upstream have not moved (or have no intention to move) to Python 3, please
 be certain that Debian benefits from the inclusion of this package.

Tag: django-package-does-not-depend-on-django
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: This package appears to be library module for the Django web development
 framework but it does not specify a binary dependency on the Django package
 itself.
 .
 Please add a Depends on <tt>python-django</tt> or <tt>python3-django</tt>.

Tag: mismatched-python-substvar
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: The specified package declares a dependency on <tt>${python:Depends}</tt>
 whilst appearing to be a Python 2.x package or a dependency on
 <tt>${python3:Depends}</tt> when it appears to be a package for Python 2.x.
 .
 Please adjust the substvar to match the intended Python version.

Tag: python-package-depends-on-package-from-other-python-variant
Severity: normal
Certainty: certain
Info: Either the specified Python 3.x package declares a dependency on a
 Python 2.x package, or the specified Python 2.x package depends on a Python
 3.x pakvage.
 .
 This is likely a typo in <tt>debian/control</tt> or due to misconfigured
 calls to, for example, <tt>dh_installdocs --link-doc=PKG</tt>.
