Info: GObject-Introspection XML files
 (<tt>/usr/share/gir-1.0/Foo-23.gir</tt>) must be made available in
 a development package in the <tt>libdevel</tt> section of the archive.
 This is normally the same <tt>libfoo-dev</tt> package that contains
 other development files.

Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: Development packages that contain GObject-Introspection XML files
 (<tt>/usr/share/gir-1.0/Foo-23.gir</tt>) must depend on the package
 containing the corresponding binary typelib, which is conventionally named
 <tt>gir1.2-foo-23</tt>. The dependency must be strictly versioned
 (for example <tt>gir1.2-foo-23 (= ${binary:Version})</tt> when using
 debhelper).
 .
 Please ignore and override this tag if the typelib is shipped in a package
 whose name does not match the typelib's machine-readable name, and the
 development package correctly depends on that package instead. For example,
 <tt>gir1.2-glib-2.0</tt> is named for the <tt>GLib-2.0</tt> typelib, but
 also contains the <tt>GObject-2.0</tt> and <tt>Gio-2.0</tt> typelibs, so
 it is correct that <tt>libglib2.0-dev</tt> depends on
 <tt>gir1.2-glib-2.0</tt> but not on <tt>gir1.2-gobject-2.0</tt> or
 <tt>gir1.2-gio-2.0</tt>.

Severity: normal
Certainty: possible
Info: GObject-Introspection binary typelibs (<tt>Foo-23.typelib</tt>)
 should normally be made available in a package named gir1.2-foo-23.
 .
 If multiple typelibs are shipped in the same package, then that package
 should have versioned <tt>Provides</tt> for the names that would have been
 used for separate packages. This arrangement should only be used if the
 included typelibs' versions are expected to remain the same at all times.
 .
 For example, <tt>gir1.2-gtk-3.0</tt> is named for the <tt>Gtk-3.0</tt>
 typelib, but also contains the <tt>Gdk-3.0</tt> and <tt>GdkX11-3.0</tt>
 typelibs. It should have versioned <tt>Provides</tt> entries for
 <tt>gir1.2-gdk-3.0 (= ${binary:Version})</tt>
 and <tt>gir1.2-gdkx11-3.0 (= ${binary:Version})</tt> to indicate this.
